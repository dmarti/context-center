      <img src="/competition-privacy/houston.jpg" alt="" role="presentation">
      <p>If you've spent any amount of time discussing reforms to improve privacy online, you've likely
  encountered the <em>Big Knob Theory</em>. Like Covid it comes in variants, but its core tenet can
  be summarised thus: there exists (metaphorically) a Big Knob that can either be turned towards
  "privacy" or towards "competition" â€” but it's very much a zero-sum game and you can't have both.
</p>
<p>Big Knob Theory (BKT) is often a strongly-held view of its proponents, many of whom take it
  simply as self-evident. More surprisingly, it is also a view commonly held by those who wished
  things were different. You can often find them deploring the fact that they would very much like
  to fix our privacy predicament, but can't because it would empower companies that already have too
  much power.</p>
<p>If it's true, and certainly if as clearly true as it is taken to be, there should be solid
  evidence and arguments to support it. Upon closer inspection, however, it turns out that the case
  for the Big Knob Theory is far from being that obvious.</p>
<p>Let's try to formulate the situation a little more rigorously so that we have a basic framework
  with which to pick through the evidence.</p>
<p>The simplest understanding of privacy that lends itself to some degree of empirical verification
  is the <em>Vegas Rule</em>: what happens in a given context stays in that context. In practical
  terms, this means that whatever a person does on a given site or app cannot be learnt by a party
  other than that site or app in such a way that the third party can then reuse that information
  elsewhere. (In technical terms, the first party is the sole data controller.) On crucial points is
  that, under the Vegas Rule, contexts are defined as different products or services, irrespective
  of whether they are owned in common. Whatever happens at the Vegas Hilton will not be known at the
  front desk of any other Hilton, and data gathered about you by your email service will not be used
  by other services owned by the same company. This definition of privacy maps well to contextual
  integrity and to people's expectations. We can understand it as measuring the fluidity of data
  flows.</p>
<p>Competition in data or data-adjacent markets can be measured with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index">HHI</a> or similar
  metrics. (Margins can also serve as a proxy measure of how contestable the market is.)</p>
<p>With these starting points, <strong>an explicit formulation of the Big Knob Theory</strong> would
  be that <em>data and data-adjacent markets will be more competitive in proportion to the fluidity
    of personal data flows between contexts, and less competitive when contexts are siloed.</em>
  What support can we find for this theory?</p>
<h2>Arguments for the <em>Big Knob Theory</em></h2>
<p>A very common argument mentioned in support of the BKT could be captured succinctly as the
  "<strong>Safari CPMs</strong>". The idea is that we can observe in the market that ad prices
  (CPMs) are measured to be significantly lower in Safari, a browser that protects privacy, than in
  Chrome, a browser that doesn't. But what this shows is only that if, <em>in the same market</em>,
  some parts have fluid data flows and others do not, then the money will flow to the former. Buyers
  who are willing to pay for decreased privacy will pay more in a system like Chrome that has a low
  level of security for personal data. It says nothing about the impact of data fluidity as it
  impacts the entire market.</p>
<p>The other primary argument for the BKT looks at <strong>the GDPR as a natural
    experiment</strong>. It comes in multiple flavours.</p>
<p>Some, like <em><a href="https://www.applicoinc.com/blog/how-gdpr-is-helping-big-tech-and-hurting-the-competition/">How
      GDPR is Helping Big Tech and Hurting the Competition</a></em>, look at the impact of the GDPR
  on Google's market share. The argument proceeds as follows: the GDPR happened, but Google's market
  share increased anyway; therefore, privacy is bad for competition. This makes two fundamental
  assumptions: 1) that the GDPR improves privacy and 2) that the GDPR is being enforced against
  platforms. Both assumptions, unfortunately, are wrong. The GDPR, as implemented today,
  unfortunately includes consent as a big loophole. This has enabled pretty much everyone to
  broadcast personal data just as much as they did prior to the GDPR simply by adding the annoyance
  of consent banners. Europe has seen very little improvement in privacy from the GDPR. (And there
  is reason to believe that GDPR-style consent, in addition to being useless for privacy, also <a href="https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/2011.12_Campbell_Goldfarb_Tucker_Privacy%20Regulation%20and%20Market%20Structure_313.pdf">helps
    larger companies</a>.) Additionally, the platforms are registered in Ireland, and Ireland is
  acting as the data equivalent of an uncooperative tax haven. Even if the GDPR improved privacy, it
  wouldn't apply to companies whose European operations are centred in Ireland.</p>
<p>Others, like <em><a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=288029089119124074065078023012027091103043056088031004087023084093070127089007100068017098101006051012034021078001125074029014122090028033029003085121008099072103015084017084101112001099031102070086120105083068094124124083067095083106122031027117096001&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">Privacy
      &amp; market concentration: Intended &amp; unintended consequences of the GDPR</a></em>, look
  at the market share of small vendors under the GDPR. Right after the GDPR comes into effect, the
  number of third-party vendors used in websites that operate under the GDPR drops 15% (with smaller
  vendors dropping more) before returning to the same level six months later (the abstract somehow
  fails to mention this last point). The theory here is that sites fear enforcement and so reduce
  their vendors â€” mostly the small ones that are less adept at compliance â€” but over time that fear
  of enforcement fades and the volume of third-party vendors returns.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the paper doesn't factor in the realities of operating a website. Sites manage
  third-party vendors like this: marketers regularly want to test new vendors, and have them added
  to the site. When a vendor doesn't pan out, marketers are supposed to ask for its removal but that
  often fails (for lack of a forcing function) and stray trackers remain on the site with no
  purpose. When the GDPR happened (which for many was a last-minute race), pretty much every website
  out there had to produce a list of all its trackers, and asked marketing to explain which ones did
  what and who to contact to get data processing addenda in place. That's a great forcing function
  to spot vendors you no longer need, which alone suffices to explain the short-lived drop in the
  number of vendors. It also explains why the drop was short (better than the suggestion that people
  stopped fearing GDPR enforcement after 6 months) and why the replacement vendors are mostly
  different ones from those that had been removed (as noted in the paper). It's hard to overestimate
  the spring cleaning effect: practitioners found and shut down <em>entire websites</em> that should
  no longer have been running; a 15% drop in the number of vendors is in fact relatively small.</p>
<p>A great overview of this strand of thinking can be found in <em><a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=509005100118099013025126110000090101062011084076070069105107082101120101072089000104001126060041109056096073068103013083088004029022075093060100011004006073081088052035024091084096091066000027106006110070030002097004097029098065068000010067117089025&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">The
      Competitive Effects of the GDPR</a></em>. In fact, this paper offers simultaneously a good
  summary of what is valuable in looking at the GDPR as a natural experiment and of why that line of
  inquiry does not support the Big Knob Theory. This paper (and others in this vein) tend to show
  that bureaucratic compliance regimes benefit large firms, as does consent-based processing. It's
  quite interesting to see that this kind of "notice and choice" isn't great from a competition
  perspective because it's also bad from a privacy standpoint.</p>
<p>It's worth a quick pause here because, to many, particularly outside of the privacy space, the
  GDPR has become synonymous with privacy. Sadly, that is hardly the case. The GDPR is first and
  foremost a thorough implementation of the fair information practices (FIPs), a privacy paradigm
  that is perfect if you are processing data in the 1970s. It is privacy that works for lawyers and
  compliance teams, heavily focused on procedural, bureaucratic solutions such as privacy policies,
  inventories, and consent. While the FIPs can be useful, and should be part of the privacy toolbox
  so long as their bureaucratic overhead is kept in check, there are simpler and more effective
  measures to improve privacy (for instance a ban on third-party data controllers) that aren't in
  the GDPR.</p>
<p>It is great that there are papers analysing the impact of the GDPR; but to the extent that they
  equate the GDPR with privacy, they are extending themselves beyond their empirical reach. The GDPR
  did not significantly and durably reduce the fluidity of data flows but it did increase the
  overhead of data processing in a way that favours companies with greater cover-your-ass expertise.
  Even if these papers do not, in fact, support the theory that improved privacy harms competition,
  they do strengthen the case against transparency and choice regimes.</p>
<p>I read a number of other papers (notably the references from those cited above) but the above
  points cover the spectrum of arguments that I've found in favour of the Big Knob Theory. While
  none actually supports the BKT itself, the related points they make can be helpful, notably in
  showing that certain bad ways of regulating privacy are also bad for competition.</p>
<h2>How Privacy Improves Data Markets</h2>
<p>In <em><a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/1077/">Incomplete
      Law</a></em>, Pistor &amp; Xu recount a history of the legal status of electricity. In the
  late 19th century, when the electrification of houses started to become more common, some
  enterprising people decided that they might as well just hook their household up straight to the
  grid without officially signing up for anything or paying anyone. Today, it is obvious to most
  that this is purely and simply theft. That view, however, was not so readily apparent to the
  courts. The German Supreme Court found that electricity could <em>not</em> be considered an asset
  in the sense that the law understood it, and only assets could be stolen â€” therefore, helping
  yourself to electricity couldn't be theft. American courts decidedly differently, but the matter
  remained contentious and was debated in New York courts until 1978.</p>
<p>We are facing a similar moment of confusion during which the status of data is challenging both
  our legal and economics traditions. Data is <em>much</em> weirder a commodity than electricity. It
  isn't easily excludable â€” copies are cheap and can be difficult to prevent â€” but it is
  nevertheless rivalrous (if you're the only one to know that I plan to buy expensive shoes, you can
  make a lot more money from shoe sellers with that information than you would if everyone knew).
  When traded, it becomes even weirder. The market itself is an information device. The interplay
  between the market as an information device with information itself being traded in that market is
  not straightforward.</p>
<p>As we increasingly apply ourselves to it, we're figuring it out. I have good hope that the 2020s
  will be the decade in which we begin to understand enough of digital society that we can start
  making it work <em>for</em> people.</p>
<p>Starting from the basics: as Neil Richards explains in <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/why-privacy-matters/9780190939045">Why Privacy
      Matters</a></em>, "<em>We live in a society in which information is power, and 'privacy' is
    the work we use to talk about the struggles over personal information, personal power, and
    personal control.</em>" Concentrations of data are concentrations of power, and from that alone
  we can hypothesise that those who extract the most data will wield the most power. What's more,
  this has the potential to create a feedback loop in which the power of data is used to capture
  further data, leading to greater data concentration. Just looking at first principles, privacy is
  the fight for more equitable and balanced power in the digital world. More equitable and more
  balanced power is good for competition, too. Is there any evidence for this that goes beyond basic
  principles?</p>
<p>As it happens, there is. I found good indications in the literature that the broad sharing of
  data across contexts has <em>anticompetitive</em> effects. Put differently, to the extent that
  there is a Big Knob somewhere, it would seem to go from "<em>No Privacy and No Competition</em>"
  to "<em>Privacy &amp; Competition</em>." Given that we live in a world that is described
  particularly well by the former setting, this idea at least passes a smell test that the Big Knob
  Theory fails.</p>
<p>Quick interlude: since we have a catchy name for the BKT, we should also conjure one up for its
  inverse. Let's go with <em>Data Accumulates Power, which Privacy Equitably Redistributes</em>. If
  you're looking, it's the DAPPER theory.</p>
<p>Policymakers broadly tend to think that DAPPER may be true. The European Commission's <em><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/publications/reports/kd0419345enn.pdf">Competition
      policy for the digital era</a></em> suspects that "<em>when it comes to dominant firms, access
    to more data may tend to strengthen dominance or allow an incumbent to leverage market
    power.</em>" The OECD's <em><a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/exploring-the-economics-of-personal-data_5k486qtxldmq-en">Exploring
      the Economics of Personal Data</a></em> points out that the "<em>monetary, economic and social
    value of personal data is likely to be governed by non-linear, increasing returns to scale. The
    value of an individual record, alone, may be very low but the value and usability of the record
    increases as the number of records to compare it with increases. These network effects have
    implications for policy because the value of the same record in a large database could be much
    more efficiently leveraged than the same record in a much smaller data set. This could have
    implications for competition and for other key policy items such as the portability of
    data</em>" and their <em><a href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/data-driven-innovation-9789264229358-en.htm">Data-Driven
      Innovation</a></em> report had similar notes. The Stigler Center's report on <em><a href="https://research.chicagobooth.edu/-/media/research/stigler/pdfs/digital-platforms---committee-report---stigler-center.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=2D23583FF8BCC560B7FEF7A81E1F95C1DDC5225E">Digital
      Platforms</a></em> notes that "<em>high and increasing returns to the use of data</em>" tend
  to "<em>push these markets towards monopolization by a single company.</em>" You can find similar
  indications in the CMA's <em><a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study">Online
      platforms and digital advertising</a></em> final report, the <em><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785547/unlocking_digital_competition_furman_review_web.pdf">Furman
      Review</a></em>, or the <em><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-cairncross-review-a-sustainable-future-for-journalism">Cairncross
      Review</a></em>.</p>
<p>Turning further towards academic sources, one great book is the classic barn-burner <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/big-data-and-competition-policy/9780198788140">Big Data and
      Competition Policy</a></em>. One perspective that Grunes &amp; Stucke describe is the "Vs" of
  data valuation. Data can be seen to have some degree of relatively intrinsic value (eg. data
  relative to a group's willingness to pay will fetch a greater price than knowing the number of
  sticks in my backyard), but other important aspects also determine what can be extracted from
  data:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Volume</strong>: The more data you have about one person, or the more people you have
    that kind of data about, the better the inferences, segmentation, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Variety</strong>: Knowing location <em>and</em> reading history is more valuable than
    the sum of the value of either taken separately, knowing the reading history from two sites is
    of higher value than one, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Veracity</strong>: Data the correctness of which is better established (including by
    obtaining it from several places) is more valuable.</li>
  <li><strong>Velocity</strong>: Most of the time, the faster you know the better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these aspects, volume and variety are particularly important: because the value of their sum
  is greater than the sum of the partsâ€™ values, whoever has more data, especially from more varied
  sources, will structurally tend to outcompete whoever has less. <strong>Because of this, broad
    sharing of data enables increased returns to scale and scope, leading to dominance,
    winner-take-all, and competition for the market rather than in the market.</strong></p>
<p>Another very interesting source is <em><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2918726">Competing with Big
      Data</a></em>. The authors develop a model in which, under typical situations of broad access
  to cross-contextual data, data-driven markets will almost always tip. And worse, because this data
  is already intermixed without respect for context, it can be leveraged into <em>other</em>
  markets. (Sticking to the Vegas Rule, the power gained from surveilling people in Vegas can be
  used to increase one's power in Atlantic City.)</p>
<p>I would like to emphasise again that a clear understanding of privacy is essential to
  understanding the value of these models. Privacy is grounded in people-centric contexts that exist
  independently from whatever structures of joint corporate ownership may exist. When Google Chrome
  sells your data to Google Search, it isn't any less a violation of privacy than when Axciom sells
  your data to Facebook. The structural competition problems created by the sharing of data across
  contexts exist equally well in the case of tracking by third parties and in the case of internal
  sharing by large corporations.</p>
<p>Such problems of data sharing across different markets are analysed excellently in <em><a href="https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=256097088074026091112091079025028081116048056043070018004100101070072118118091066100062035127024024056008088075074027108117077019069008041042095121084070087109026009057126003009064095031066117087112065000081067084024090001028092021068103017125003&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">Data-driven
      Envelopment with Privacy-Policy Tying</a></em>. Condorelli &amp; Padilla build a simple theory
  in which a firm that has a dominant position in a market where data is key will use the profits
  from that market to enter one or more secondary data-rich markets and engage in predatory pricing
  there (often simply opting for free products). In turn, the data from the secondary market will
  bolster dominance in the primary market, leading to a vicious cycle of entrenchment. They
  illustrate the structure simply:</p><img alt="A diagram illustrating cross-market leveraging of data" src="/competition-privacy/Untitled.png">
<p>Crucially, this model only works if the firm is able (thanks to technology) and allowed (thanks
  to law and the practices of its privacy policy) to exploit data captured in one market in another.
  I find this model particularly appealing because it strongly matches the behaviour of dominant
  firms in the real world.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in some models, data sharing <em>can</em> be pro-competitive, but you
  basically have to share <em>all</em> the data. Intuitively, if you nullify the advantages from
  data collection you eliminate competition issues in data. This works in <em><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2918726">Competing with Big
      Data</a></em> and with the "Vs" model too: if everyone has all the data, then there are no
  structural advantages to volume or variety. Even if the privacy issues weren't insuperable (which
  they are), building the infrastructure to grant everyone access to all the world's personal data
  would present a huge challenge.</p>
<p>As we can see, there are good reasons to believe that sharing data across contexts creates
  competition issues â€” the DAPPER theory seems to hold water, and what's more to match the reality
  of how dominant firms behave. Is there anything that we can do about this?</p>
<h2>Some Potential Solutions</h2>
<p>My primary purpose here was to share my own travel through the literature to indicate that,
  indeed, we have solid reasons to believe that sharing data across contexts <em>creates</em>
  competition issues and that the Big Knob Theory, while we can learn from it in refusing
  transparency and choice frameworks, generally seems unfounded. I can, however, share a few
  pointers towards what I think could be solutions.</p>
<p>The first step is that we should <strong>pursue strong context silos whenever possible</strong>
  so as to avoid the structural issues that stem from cross-context sharing. One simple policy
  prescription is to <strong>ban third-party data controllers</strong> (with perhaps a tiny set of
  very narrow and strictly enforced exemptions). There is little business benefit to them and they
  produce great privacy harm. It is important to note that, as per the joint CMA/ICO statement
  <em><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/987358/Joint_CMA_ICO_Public_statement_-_final_V2_180521.pdf">Competition
      and data protection in digital markets</a></em> (notably Â§79), intra-company transfers between
  different services should be similarly outlawed. CPRA-like regimes should treat different services
  as different businesses in their definition of "sale" as that more accurately reflects reality and
  privacy impacts.</p>
<p>Another important step would be to <strong>enforce strongly against self-preferential practices
    that create differential access to data</strong>. I think specifically of cases in which a
  company uses its operating system, app store, or browser to prevent others from sharing across
  contexts, but avails itself of data coming from interactions with these systems. This remains a
  problem when the effects are indirect, for instance observing behaviour on the sites of
  competitors in the ad market to improve search services. Increasing the scale of the latter is
  anticompetitive in the former. This would include enforcing <em><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3180174">The Separation of Platforms
      and Commerce</a></em>.</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>building privacy-preserving alternatives</strong> (so long as they don't make
  it possible to exploit data dominance in other ways) to today's data-hungry services can help a
  lot. More generally, we can consider better ways of structuring data-adjacent markets: instead of
  pooling all the personal data collected from smaller sites into ever-bigger companies that then
  gain the ability to outcompete smaller ones, we should set the data market up in such a way that
  it trades in <em>insights derived locally from the data</em>. This enables greater innovation at
  the edges by empowering publishers to put their greater local knowledge of their own audiences to
  work and to monetise that instead of the raw material. This approach strongly aligns competition
  objectives with improved data protection by severely limiting the need for sharing personal data.
  It is a key component of several ongoing proposals to reform online advertising, such as
  Microsoftâ€™s <em><a href="https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md">PARAKEET</a></em>
  or The New York Timesâ€™s <em><a href="https://darobin.github.io/garuda/">GARUDA</a></em>. (I wrote
  about a high-level overview of the general idea in <em><a href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/opinion/The_New_York_Times_Identity_isnt_about_identifiers_its_about_people/4320">Identity
      isnâ€™t about identifiers â€“ itâ€™s about people</a></em>.)</p>
<p>In order to support strong technical privacy at the edges, where data enters the system, we
  should deploy <strong>a fiduciary regime for all user agents</strong> (browsers, operating
  systems, voice assistants, and many more). See <em><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3827421">The Fiduciary Duties of
      User Agents</a></em>, which I hope to update soon.</p>
<p>The details vary, but overall the direction is simple: many of the best competition remedies that
  we have at our disposal in digital markets are privacy remedies. Whichever way you come at it, the
  future looks DAPPER.</p>
