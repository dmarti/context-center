                        @mkramer @robinberjon Yeah, this too! It isn't accidental that Wikipedia editors and librarians tend to overlap. I think the thing we need is a way that empowers people with passion and expertise to make the best indexes and represent themselves as candidates to join your search tool to.</p>

                        @Chronotope @mkramer I love this model (and librarians)! So, this would need shared access to crawl (so as not to duplicate infrastructure, à la common crawl), an API to query federated indices, and ILP so people can be paid and infra costs covered. It's not crazy hard!</p>

                        @robinberjon @mkramer I don't know if you'd need a shared crawler, crawling is easy and these days fairly cheap. You just need a shared crawler standard and an agreement to use a common user agent I think?</p>

                        @robinberjon @mkramer I think this could get really interesting if it came together with Hyperdrive, your browsing than stands in for the crawler and your storage hosts an index which gets auto joined via connections, with larger servers using Hyper agents to pull federation into the standard web.</p>

                        @Chronotope @mkramer I considered that, but how do you prevent this from including super private stuff that shows up in page?</p>

                        @robinberjon @mkramer Yeah that part is a little messy, but maybe start with 'click to add', build a blocklist, evolve the process. Private URLs are a relatively small set compared to the rest of the web I'd bet, and many have common characteristics.</p>

                        @Chronotope @mkramer I don't know, that would not be foolproof enough. Like, your name would be caught up with news content if you're signed in.</p>

                        @Chronotope @mkramer How about: sites *push* their content to be indexed, along with IP terms (to prevent the hostile mining that Google does but also independent repub), and Hyper agents are used to verify that real site content matches the index, to catch cheaters.</p>
