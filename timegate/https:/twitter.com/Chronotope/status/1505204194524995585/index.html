                        @Chronotope @robinberjon Hmm, an interesting idea. I wonder how effectively you could integrate heterogeneous indices into a cohesive general search experience?

Wikipedia and Mastodon bring together content from many different sources, but all following a very restricted form.</p>

                        @Chronotope @robinberjon But I suspect there's a lot of potential variation in how different indices are best structured, and queried.

I run a very niche index in Well-Known, and would love to contribute that to a project like this, but it's built very differently to a general purpose search engine.</p>

                        @Chronotope @robinberjon If you're meaning people only contribute on *what* gets indexed, with most of the technical indexing implementation common/fixed, that seems more clearly doable. But also suggests to me a centralised platform like Wikipedia, which needs a large entity to host it.</p>

                        @braedon @Chronotope I think it's possible to be more distributed than Wikipedia, but I agree that providing infrastructure is key. You need a lot of common interfaces and the ability to develop bureaucracy where needed.</p>

                        @robinberjon @braedon Yeah, for sure! I think core concepts include being able to join &amp; participate in an indexing project in some way, being able to request &amp; refuse peering, &amp; being able to merge similar structured indices w/different data, &amp; allowing any indexing project to choose merge priorities</p>
