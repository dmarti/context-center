But that’s easier said than done.</p><p>Anyone who has shopped for a mask online or in stores has discovered a dizzying array in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors. Knowing which mask to pick and making sure it’s not a counterfeit requires the sleuthing skills of a forensic investigator. And once you choose one, it’s still a gamble; many people discover they’ve ordered a mask that’s too big or too small for their face or just doesn’t fit right.</p><p>“No one has made this easy, that’s for sure,” said Bill Taubner, president of <a href="https://bonafidemasks.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bona Fide Masks</a>, the exclusive distributor in the United States for both Powecom and Harley KN95 masks, which are from China. “A lot of people end up doing a lot of research.”</p></div><div><p>Unlike cloth masks, high-quality masks — called N95s, KN95s and KF94s — are made with layers of high-tech filtering material that trap at least 94 to 95 percent of the most risky particles. Under a microscope, the filters look like dense forests of tangled fibers that capture even the hardest-to-trap particles that can bounce around and escape the fibers of cloth masks. High-grade masks also have an electrostatically charged filter that helps attract and trap particles.</p></div><div><p>Early in the pandemic, high-quality medical and respirator-style masks were in short supply. Now the problem is there are so many different masks for sale, it’s tough to know which ones have been tested and certified by government agencies, and which are counterfeit. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Testing studies</a> have found that many counterfeit masks don’t even offer the same level of protection as a cloth mask. We interviewed mask manufacturers, importers, public health officials and independent researchers for advice on choosing a quality mask. Here’s a guide.</p><h2 id="link-26dfd18">Choose your mask style.</h2><p>Masks come in different shapes and sizes. You’ll find “cup” style masks, “duck bill” masks and “flat-fold” masks. The best mask is the one that fits snugly against your face and is comfortable. Start by ordering in small quantities and try different styles to find the best one for your face. Many masks are described as “one size fits most.” But some come in small or larger sizes. “You’re not getting the full benefit of a respirator if you put it on and it’s not forming a seal to your face,” said Nicole Vars McCullough, vice president for personal safety at the 3M Company, the largest U.S. manufacturer of N95 masks.</p><h3 id="link-5a1d3deb"><span>N95 respirator</span></h3></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/13/well/13well-n95mask-guide0/13well-n95mask-guide0-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/13/well/13well-n95mask-guide0/13well-n95mask-guide0-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/13/well/13well-n95mask-guide0/13well-n95mask-guide0-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><img alt="In most situations, you don’t need to throw out your disposable mask after each use." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/13/well/13well-n95mask-guide0/13well-n95mask-guide0-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/13/well/13well-n95mask-guide0/13well-n95mask-guide0-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/13/well/13well-n95mask-guide0/13well-n95mask-guide0-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/02/13/well/13well-n95mask-guide0/13well-n95mask-guide0-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"></picture></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Sarah Kobos/Wirecutter</span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The <strong>N95</strong> respirator mask is regulated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost all N95 masks use head straps — two elastic bands that wrap behind the head. If a mask claiming to be an N95 has ear loops, it’s most likely a fake. The C.D.C. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2021-124/pdfs/2021-124.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has a guide</a> for spotting fake N95s.</p></div><div><p><h3 id="link-2995f6a7"><span>KN95 respirator</span></h3></p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Sarah Kobos/Wirecutter</span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The <strong>KN95</strong> is similar to the N95, but it has ear loops and is made to meet Chinese standards for medical masks. Some people prefer them for comfort, and because they come in smaller sizes. While you can find legitimate KN95 masks, the supply chain is riddled with counterfeits and there’s little regulation or oversight of the product. One study found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">60 percent of the supply of KN95s</a> in the United States are counterfeit. Keep reading for ways to spot them.</p><h3 id="link-18601"><span>KF94</span></h3></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Sarah Kobos/Wirecutter</span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The <strong>KF94</strong> is a high-quality mask that folds flat and is made in Korea. It is designed specifically for the consumer market. The KF stands for “Korean filter,” and the 94 means it filters 94 percent of particles. The masks are heavily regulated in Korea, which lowers the risk of counterfeits. However, some fake masks made in China may be labeled KF94, so shoppers still need to do their homework.</p><h3 id="link-50b0e86e"><span>Masks for children</span></h3><p>The mask market is particularly tricky for parents trying to find masks for children. No N95 mask has been approved for children, so any mask that claims to be an N95 for kids is a fake. However, N95s do come in S/M sizes that might work for some older children. KN95 and KF94 masks have styles made for children, so once you find one, you need to go through the same vetting process that you would use for an adult mask, using the links below.</p><h2 id="link-73d4c651">Buy from a reputable supplier.</h2><p>Big retailers like Home Depot and Lowes typically work directly with manufacturers approved by NIOSH or their distributors, so if you find an N95 mask in a major retail store you can be confident you’re getting the real thing. It’s a good idea to check manufacturer websites to see where they sell their products and who their authorized distributors are, Dr. McCullough said. 3M has a dedicated spot on its website to help <a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/worker-health-safety-us/covid19/covid-fraud/?utm_medium=redirect&amp;utm_source=vanity-url&amp;utm_campaign=3m.com/covidfraud" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consumers spot fake masks.</a></p><p>Finding a reliable mask on Amazon is trickier because you’ll see legitimate masks mixed in with counterfeits, although the differences won’t always be obvious. If you must use Amazon, try to shop directly in the on-site stores of mask makers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/3M+Personal+Protective+Equipment/page/D9E33F3B-99C9-471A-9713-580D0CC74FF9?ref_=ast_bln" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3M</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/2594826011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Kimberly-Clark%20Professional&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_2594826011" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kimberly-Clark</a>. (You can usually find a link to a maker’s online store right below a product name.)</p></div><div><p>If you’re buying a KF94 on Amazon, look closely at the packaging to make sure it’s made in Korea and includes the required labeling (see below for more details). Aaron Collins, an engineer who routinely tests masks and who has gained a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/coll0412" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube following</a> as “Mask Nerd,” recommends buying KF94s from Korean beauty product importers like <a href="https://behealthyusa.net/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Be Healthy</a> or <a href="https://kmact.com/products/dr-puri-kf94-mask-for-adult" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KMact</a>. Once you learn the names of a few KF94 manufacturers, you can try to find their websites to learn where they are sold. For instance, <a href="http://happylifekorea.com/eng/index.php" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Happy Life</a> lists its five U.S. distributors on its home page.</p><p>You can sometimes find N95 and KN95 masks for sale directly on the website of a mask maker, <a href="https://shop.demetech.us/products/n95-respirator-masks-fold-style?variant=40938094297264" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like Demetech</a> and <a href="https://www.armbrustusa.com/collections" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Armbrust USA</a>. You can also look for companies that are exclusive distributors of KN95 masks, like <a href="https://bonafidemasks.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bona Fide Masks</a>. The nonprofit site <a href="https://www.projectn95.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project N95</a> is also a reliable place to shop. Many trusted sites are overwhelmed by demand right now, so you may encounter delays in fulfillment and shipping times.</p><h2 id="link-50c99808">Check labels and printing.</h2><p>Legitimate N95s and KN95s are required to have specific text stamped on the front of the mask. Although you may find one in a fun color, masks that are printed with fancy designs or don’t have text stamped on them are probably fake.</p><p>Your N95 should be stamped with “NIOSH,” as well as the company name, the model and lot numbers, and something called a “TC approval” number, which can be used to look up the mask on a list of approved ones. The C.D.C. has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/N95-Infographic-Mask-Labeling-508.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created an infographic</a> showing you the printing to look for on your N95.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span><span>Credit...</span><span>Charlie Rubin for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>A legitimate KN95 should also be stamped with text, including the name of the manufacturer, the model, and “GB2626-2019,” which is a reference to a quality control standard approved by the Chinese government. (If your mask has a GB number that ends in 2006, which is a previous standard, just check the expiration date.)</p><p>The KF94 won’t be stamped with text, but the package should say “Made in Korea” and include the product name, manufacturer and distributor name. Each mask should be packaged individually in a flat, glossy rectangular wrapper with a textured border. The package will also have an expiration date and a lot number printed on it. (Masks that carry an electrostatic charge all have expiration dates.) If your mask comes from a Korean importer, the information on the package will be in Korean, but many companies have begun to create English-language packaging.</p></div><div><h2 id="link-995e9b3">Use trusted sources.</h2><p>A number of resources have sprung up to help people navigate the mask-buying process. <a href="https://shop.projectn95.org/masks/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project N95</a> is a nonprofit known for vetting its mask suppliers. Mr. Collins, the Mask Nerd, has created a number of lists and resources for mask buyers. You can check out his <a href="https://twitter.com/masknerd" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter feed</a>, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3fF_rzkmZD0ufN685YE7lg" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M0mdNLpTWEGcluK6hh5LjjcFixwmOG853Ff45d3O-L0/htmlview?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=108355114845682180386&amp;pru=AAABfniWips*ZW4K5ipiMBIUEgzyHDB1eA" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a spreadsheet</a> he has created of nearly 450 different masks and how they performed in his tests.</p><p>Mr. Collins may be best known for his list of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i06OAItoOwIUaMjElr8mhh0Rw-it6WL-ODIQMZUOQxE/edit#gid=0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">children’s masks</a>. While there is no N95 mask for kids approved in the United States, mask makers in China and Korea have created KN95s and KF94s for children, including some with child-friendly colors and prints. Mr. Collins created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A88AGnN-nwI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a video “primer for parents”</a> about finding a high-quality mask for kids that has more than 100,000 views.</p><p>“I had retired from mask testing,” Mr. Collins said, noting that he doesn’t receive any compensation for his work. “But I came out of retirement to do the kids video. The only place I’ve seen a list of test data is unfortunately me.”</p><p>Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, has a guide <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/where-to-buy-n95-kn95-masks-online/" title="">for buying quality masks</a>, one for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-kids-face-masks/" title="">buying children’s masks</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/12-signs-you-have-a-fake-n95-kn95-or-kf94-mask/" title="">a list of 12 red flags</a> that might signal your mask is a counterfeit.</p><h2 id="link-341060bd">Do your research.</h2><p>It’s not easy, but the C.D.C. has a few lists you can use to confirm a mask has been vetted. A note of caution: If you don’t find a particular mask, make sure you’ve looked it up the correct way, said Anne Miller, executive director of <a href="https://www.projectn95.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project N95</a>. For instance, a Gerson N95 mask won’t be found under the letter “G.” It’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/N95list1sect2-l.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listed under “L”</a> because the full name of the company that makes it is Louis M. Gerson.</p><p>For N95 masks, go to the C.D.C.’s alphabetical list of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/default.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NIOSH-approved respirators</a>. You can also look up the TC approval number using the <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-cel/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certified equipment list</a>.</p><p>For KN95 masks, you can use two checklists from the Food and Drug Administration. The F.D.A. created these lists early in the pandemic, when the agency issued an emergency use authorization that allowed health workers to use KN95 masks because of a shortage of N95s. Now that the N95 supply is adequate, the agency has revoked the authorization for these workers, but other people can still use KN95s. While the list is now a bit outdated, finding your mask on it adds reassurance that it’s less likely to be counterfeit — with the caveat that there’s no longer official U.S. oversight for any of these firms. You’ll need to scroll down to find the list and search box.</p><p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/revoked-euas-non-niosh-approved-disposable-filtering-facepiece-respirators#china" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Use this F.D.A. list</a> to find KN95 masks made in China, and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/revoked-euas-non-niosh-approved-disposable-filtering-facepiece-respirators#imported" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this list</a> for KN95 masks made in other countries.</p><p>Jin Yu Young<!-- --> contributed to this report.</p></div></section></article></div>
