                        Insurance is NOT a Ponzi scheme. 

Because you hope to lose the money you pay for an insurance policy. You're handing over your hard-earned money willingly, for peace of mind, to a company that will likely payout in an adverse situation.

Close, but a zero-sum game...</p>

Miners (first adopters) are the only ones who get paid out, plus they require new fiat (!) coming in to finance their (centralized) mining pools.

They also offer 18% APY on crypto "deposits". 

Probably nothing... https://t.co/iPFjScrS8Y</p>
