                        Discussions of web3 always head towards the idea that consumers will adopt new ways of consuming media that will compensate them for their data. There are some companies trying to do this (@PermissionIO). It‚Äôs got a lot of problems, and doesn‚Äôt require web3. 10/21</p>

                        @PermissionIO And again if you really want to execute a scheme to pay for user data, it makes sense to do it at the browser level (Brave) rather than at the execution level in a new social network or media company that will only have part of the consumer‚Äôs overall attention. 13/21</p>

                        @PermissionIO In contrast, when you visit a newspaper website you are bombarded with poorly targeted garbage that makes the content hard to read, revs your CPU, and disrespects the user. That‚Äôs the decentralized, ad hoc ad tech stack. 18/21</p>

                        @PermissionIO Zooming out, why would you expect anything else out of the religion of decentralization? Having many competing services that are mashed together however any party chooses will naturally be messy and difficult, across all web3 initiatives. 19/21</p>

                        @PermissionIO There may be very specific areas where web3 projects intersect with the media/advertising landscape and add value. Single sign-on using NFTs. Verification of  advertising transaction counter-parties. I‚Äôll wait and see. 20/21</p>

                        @PermissionIO But in general:

-The problem of concentration in media is caused by consumer choice. 
-Paying consumers to change their behavior is IMHO not going to happen at scale. 
-Decentralization is literally the last thing ad tech needs.
