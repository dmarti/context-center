                        20/Bitcoin and NFTs have been packaged as helping “the little guy” get ahead. This is called “class collaboration” and weaponizes working people on behalf of the ultra-rich. Mussolini did this too, under the name “class collaboration.”

                        21/And in fact, most Bitcoin is controlled by just a few people; it’s not “democratized” in any way. Just 0.01% hold 27%. It’s just one more shot at the old “sound money” fever dream, floated on the backs of average people as accomplices.

                        22/No discussion of crypto would be complete without mentioning its staggering waste of energy; or the real goal of displacing the dollar as the reserve currency, so as to maximize oil/gas industry returns over time. Learn about that in my audio series.

                        25/This is part of an effort to destabilize the world so the “gold” network can gain primacy and “evolve” the human race. I didn’t sign up for this agenda, nor did most people. Awareness can stop it, but it needs to be crushed with prejudice. Just like Smedley Butler did in 1934.</p>
