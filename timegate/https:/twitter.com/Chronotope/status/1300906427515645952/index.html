The technology making this possible: #Bitcoin as a battery.

Not mining any bitcoin.

                        I thought maybe cap and trade would be a more effective comparison but in theory at least you're supposed to be reducing preexisting pollution there. Here you're creating more energy use for the purpose of arbitrage down the line on that power use.</p>

                        I both believe this is legal and also am incredibly depressed that we created a country where we put ourselves in a position where this is legal. https://t.co/bSc1eqdnuj</p>

                        This is an interesting discussion around a different angle to look at this, though I'm not sure I'm quite so positive about the impact in my read. https://t.co/7uJ2G5sg90</p>

                            a bitcoin mine bleeding the grid of power, then selling that power back to the people it's bleeding it from at 7x cost is really something
