                    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Never bother to read the privacy policy when signing up for a cryptocurrency exchange? Maybe you should.</p></div><div><p>For <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/privacyweek/" target="_blank">Privacy Week</a>, CoinDesk reviewed the privacy policies and notices of 24 major crypto exchanges and lending services to see how much they know about users and how transparent they are about it. The two dozen companies represent a cross-section of popular consumer-facing platforms.</p></div><div><p>It turns out crypto platforms collect a wealth of their users’ personal data – ironic considering this asset class grew out of the privacy-championing <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html" target="_blank">cypherpunk</a> movement and was originally conceived as <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">anonymous digital cash</a>.</p></div><div><p>All major crypto services these days are subject to laws and regulations obliging them to perform know-your-customer (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-kyc-and-why-does-it-matter-for-crypto/" target="_blank">KYC</a>) checks on any new client. Crypto platforms are inherently online so to make sure they are dealing with the same person who submitted ID documents, over the past few years they adopted biometric verification, asking prospective users to provide a photo with their ID, a short video of themselves or both.</p></div><div><p>Given that many of these platforms are accepting fiat payments from bank accounts of their clients to let them buy crypto with their local currencies (acting as so-called fiat on-ramps), they also process users’ banking information, and in some cases tax IDs, too.</p></div><div><p>Such platforms collect their users' home addresses, phone numbers, employment information, banking details, photos of their IDs and photos and/or videos of their faces. In addition, platforms can see the entire history of their users' trades, cryptocurrency addresses they use to deposit and withdraw funds and any transactions related to them on public blockchains.</p></div><div><p>Platforms also routinely gather technical information about the devices users are logging in from, including operating systems, browser details, IP addresses and the location and time zone settings of computers and phones their clients use to trade.</p></div><div><p>This is a pretty typical set of data more or less any regulated crypto service would process and store. However, they differ in the amount of data they store, how they protect users' privacy and how much they disclose about such practices.</p></div><div><p>The companies explain in their privacy policies that they use this data to provide quality service to their clients, prevent fraud and keep customers posted about relevant news and updates. However, this abundance of personal information makes the platforms huge data banks – and, in cases of security breaches, they may become <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/07/binance-customer-data-has-leaked-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont/">sources of massive leaks</a>.</p></div><div><p>It's hard to verify how companies are actually handling their users’ data. But by reading the privacy policies these companies publish on their websites, we can see how explicit and forthright they are about it.</p></div><div><p>Here are some of the issues to be mindful of.</p></div><div><p><h2>Financial data use and storage</h2></p></div><div><p>Crypto platforms provide varying levels of disclosure about the data they receive and store related to users' financials. (In this article, we don't look at the financial information platforms collect about corporate users, only about individuals.)</p></div><div><p>Most of the privacy policies CoinDesk reviewed mentioned bank account numbers and (as one would expect) trading history on the platform. Crypto lending provider BlockFi stood out with the longest list of types of banking data it collects. Exchanges <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/privacy" target="_blank">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/privacy-notice" target="_blank">BitMEX</a>, <a href="https://poloniex.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Poloniex</a>, and OKX (formerly <a href="https://www.okx.com/support/hc/en-us/articles/360021590732-Privacy-Policy-Statement" target="_blank">OKEx</a>) did not mention what banking data they collect at all in their privacy policies.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://paxful.com/privacy-notice" target="_blank">Paxful</a> mentions that financial information may be stored if users send it to their trading counterparties via the chat on the platform, as Paxful keeps the chat records.</p></div><div><p>"BitMEX doesn’t operate any fiat payment gateways for its users and so does not receive credit card or other banking information in respect of its users,” explained BitMEX Communications and Content Manager Jessica Lindeman. “Instead users are able to purchase XBT or USDT through Banxa,” a payments company.</p></div><div><p>Poloniex said via spokesperson Gabriel Wang that it too "does not deal with fiat directly, so no credit card/banking info is stored on our system."</p></div><div><p>Richard Kay, OKX’s senior public relations manager in the U.K. and Europe, said the exchange also does not store its users’ banking information. That's taken care of by third-party payment providers, including Coinify, MoonPay, Okcoin, Banxa, Mercuryo, Simplex and Itez, he said.</p></div><div><p>Binance told CoinDesk via spokesperson that it actually does process banking information. "We would would only process credit card or banking information when users decide to share this information with Binance, for transactional purposes, as it is not mandatory information to open an account," the company added.</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><p>Platform</p></th><th><p>Financial data collected, according to privacy policy</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Bakkt (last updated Oct. 28, 2020)</p></td><td><p>Bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, details of transactions on the platform</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Binance (last updated Jan. 12, 2022)</p></td><td><p>Transaction history</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bitfinex (last updated May 27, 2021)</p></td><td><p>Bank statements, bank account number</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>BitMEX (last updated Aug. 28, 2020)</p></td><td><p>Payment details, including wallet address(es)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bitstamp (last updated Nov. 5, 2020)</p></td><td><p>Bank account number, bank statement and trading information</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bittrex (last updated Dec. 31, 2019)</p></td><td><p>Bank account and payment details, transactions data, portfolio data</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Blockchain.com (last updated Dec. 16, 2021)</p></td><td><p>Bank account information and/or credit card details, transactions history and account balances</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>BlockFi (last updated June 15, 2021)</p></td><td><p>"Transaction Data such as cryptocurrency wallet address(es), information relating to your BlockFi account and cryptocurrency trading transactions and related information for deposits or withdrawals, credit card information (last four digits of number, expiration date, card status), credit card payment information (amount, date, frequency, status, balance), information relating to credit card transactions;<br>

Various services provide different levels of openness about which companies they share users' data with, and about their reasons for doing so.</p></div><div><p>Some companies merely mention they might share data with third parties, while others provide names and explanations, with varying degrees of detail.</p></div><div><p>Bitfinex and BitMEX provided the longest lists of counterparties they share data with. Bitfinex lists third parties at the end of its<a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank"> privacy policy</a> and BitMEX has a<a href="https://www.bitmex.com/app/dataPartners" target="_blank"> special page</a> dedicated to the list of its data partners.</p></div><div><p>Europe-based platforms normally mention, among other things, if they are transferring users' data to any places outside the EU, and how they make sure such transfers are secure. These parts of the privacy policies look pretty similar across different platforms.</p></div><div><p>Many companies separately describe their approaches for EU citizens, whose personal data since 2018 has been protected by the<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank"> General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR), or for Californians, under the <a href="https://privacyrights.org/resources/california-consumer-privacy-act-basics" target="_blank">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA). Some platforms also specify their treatment of residents of Vermont, which has its own<a href="https://ago.vermont.gov/privacy-data-security/#:~:text=Vermont's%20Social%20Security%20Number%20Protection,Numbers%20and%20other%20personal%20information." target="_blank"> local privacy laws</a>.</p></div><div><p>We won’t delve into those sections in this article, as they’re largely relevant only to residents of these particular areas, but if you are one, check if your crypto service notes anything important for you.</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><p>Crypto exchange</p></th><th><p>Third parties with access to data</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Bakkt (last updated Oct. 28, 2020)</p></td><td><p>Service providers and/or data processors, counterparties in transactions, financial institutions and credit bureaus, other third parties</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Binance (last updated Jan. 12, 2022)</p></td><td><p>Subsidiaries or affiliates, third-party service providers and others.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bitfinex (last updated May 27, 2021)</p></td><td><p>Bitrefill, Chainalysis, Celsius Network, getResponse, happyCOINS, hCaptcha, Mercuryo, OWNR WALLET, WorldCheck, Twilio, Simplex, Zendesk.
