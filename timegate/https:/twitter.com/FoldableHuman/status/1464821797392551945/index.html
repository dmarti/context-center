                        A thing that’s somewhat surprising about this degree of laziness. Only two of these have something that can really be described as a tangible attached product. Only one promising a game even bothered to have mock-up screenshots. This is surprising to me because...</p>

                        Logic would dictate that the modicum of effort it requires to mock up a preview of your game/comic/animation would help you stand out in a high competition environment, doubly so when basically no one is bothering.

We know it’s a low hurdle as even scam kickstarters manage it.</p>

                        The implied answer is buyers don’t actually care. Evidence of work on an end product doesn’t improve your odds of success, it’s an irrelevant factor in the calculus of the market.</p>

                        What *does* seem to be effective (or at least perceived as effective) as it’s regularly employed, is a promise of charitable donations, specific or vague.

It speaks to market anxieties about appearing wealth-obsessed, parasitic, and destructive.</p>

                        The singular review I've found of the episode sums it up as largely unremarkable, like something you'd find on 2013 Newgrounds from a decent animator who just isn't very funny.

It is so unmemorable that no one has bothered to bootleg it.

It costs at least $1000 to access.</p>

                        But don't worry, it's all decentralized.

Minus, I guess, the servers that the video is hosted on. And the server that does the authentication. And the web portal that allows you to watch the video. And the Discord chatroom.</p>

                        But the database that holds the note saying you have permission to watch the video, that's decentralized! no one can take that away!

Unless the miners who keep the database updated get bored or move on and stop updating it. Or a new version comes out and breaks it.</p>

                        Like, gosh, it really is curious that only a handful of large companies, globally, are able to navigate the labyrinthian rules involved in gambling across international borders. I'm sure that's purely because they just haven't put enough gumption into it.</p>

                        I showed this pitch to a friend who did work on the backend of online casinos, specifically interfacing with compliance, and she just went silent for a bit before "they would literally face fewer consequences if they just stole the money instead."</p>

                            Remember Reservationhop? It was founded by an SF bro who couldn't get restaurant reservations so he had a brainwave: what if I found a "business" that creates fake identities and books every table in town and then auctions them off to would-be diners?

                        Okay, you know how being a F2P player in games like Hearthstone often involves a lot of frustration from being frequently matched against players with dramatically better decks?

Now imagine the buy-in just to get to *that* level was north of $450. https://t.co/zpcBVyzjVO</p>

                        Something that tickles me is the way that the projects will just describe a vision of a truly awful game.

"Imagine if you could rent your sword to other players!"

"Imagine if you could sell your rare drops for $!"</p>

                        An extremely relevant case study is Diablo 3's Real Money Auction House.

If powerful items can be freely traded amongst the entire player base then drop odds need to be balanced around the entire player base. Which means your average play session is deeply unsatisfying.</p>

                        Basic 1/10 stuff becomes 1/1000.

Truly rare items that in a compartmentalized environment would be 1/10,000 odds need to be 1/1,000,000,000.

You know someone who got something good once, but that's about it.</p>

                        Axie is probably the most respectable enterprise in this whole endeavour, in the sense that they have a working game that exists, and I pretty much instantly stumbled into a sub-scam just by checking Twitch to see what the $450 game was like.</p>

                            @FoldableHuman Have you seen the Axie white paper? There's this great bit where they admit player income is "growth-dependent" (= flagrant Ponzi scheme), but they're confident they can get nonprofit donors and government grants to keep things going out of "the will to do good" https://t.co/zdUmUEkdJG

                        There is, deep in the core, a foundational disconnect in values. By volume, compared to "line goes up" dickheads, the amount of stuff in the space that's driven by artists, tinkerers, and people who want to make neat things regardless of how much it can be sold for rounds to zero https://t.co/mkXlngUF3T</p>

                        Most of the NFTs being pushed by brands and artists aren't internal products. Teams approach them, offer to do all the dev and just say "all you need to do is sign off on the art."

And if they burn your audience they slink off into the night.

                        And it has to be driven by those people, because every meaningful state change requires paying Gas, a processing fee to the people who run the computes that keep the ledger updated, and Gas is auctioned on a highest-bidder-first system. It's pay-to-play at all levels. https://t.co/z8aNSybSE4</p>

                        Crypto nerds have been itching for the opportunity to put things like real estate deeds and medical records "onto blockchain" for a decade now, insisting that the best place to store these is an open air database.

The entire exercise is fundamentally sociopathic.</p>

                        It all treats the actual game dev as a trivial element that can just be willed into existence.

                        Lofty claim that they become building blocks, but they really don’t. They’re not even game assets, they’re the concept of a game asset. The NFT of a chair in The Sims does not magically confer a properly modelled chair with a working hit box for Skyrim.</p>

                        Crypto Astronuts launched their minting on Saturday, but only sold 1262 of their planned 10,000 in the first 24h, working out to ~$350,000 but far short of the $2.8m target.

                        Everyone is looking to flip, it's a question of how fast. If the average resale falls below the mint cost, the project dies.

                        The project leaders have done their part to manipulate the price, "burning" the un-minted Astronuts by altering the mint starting time to 16 October 2099, but the floor price still sits at ~$90, well below the $300 mint cost.</p>

                        There are a lot of reasons for pushback, the project was aimed at minors, the copyright issues are myriad, the idea wasn't very good, but I think the root is accidentally elucidated in Julie Zhuo's description (from a now-deleted Medium post)

                            From this description by Julie Zhuo, Realms of Ruin really does appear to simply be a collaborative fanfiction project except you have to pay money in order to make stories and also harm the environment. 

For a free alternative, simply join the @scpwiki and then murder a tree. https://t.co/OLqHwTp5YY

                        The philosophy here, a story that is community-created and owned, is philosophically incompatible with crypto, which operates, intentionally and by design, on strict notions of property and possession. Collective ownership, formal or colloquial, is antithetical to crypto.</p>

                        For the record if any of the authors involved want to talk, I have so many questions. How was this pitched to you, by who? How were you told it would function? What did you believe you were selling? What did you imagine readers would think?</p>

                        This is a good rundown of the Realms of Ruin situation, though there's a couple paragraphs I want to highlight because I think they miss the point in a way that speaks to the broader state of things.

                        This, for example, is largely fantasy and also just wrong. There's no intrinsic chain of influence that's tracked, only a chain of ownership. Even if your story influences mine I can just... not say so. The connection is entirely analog. https://t.co/ufNLO1YKR6</p>

                        Also the royalties are not intrinsic. They're a common feature of popular "smart contracts" but they still need to be coded into the NFT. It's exactly the same as the sentence that follows: you don't get royalties unless you have a contract that stipulates royalties.</p>

                        Lastly this statement on values is extremely misleading. The money still has to come from somewhere, and the dominant Web3 model, encased in crypto, is to replace ad-based monetization with financialization. https://t.co/odoviMNAz3</p>

                        Basically if you're already not fond of ad-based monetization you're really not going to like monetization based on betting on fractionalized derivatives of the artwork packaged into abstract financial instruments.</p>

                        He has successfully petitioned for the largest marketplaces to blacklist the tokens, ceding de facto censorial power to the marketplaces. The next step would be for BAYC to repeal any member benefits associated with those tokens, admitting that the privileges exist at their whim. https://t.co/kzt1zSULHY</p>

                        On a whole other level, though, is that he minted a token of a photo of a note and sent the token to the wallet of the thieves.

                        Second it reveals a massive security and privacy hole in the entire system, which is that people who are so inclined can attempt to dump tokens into your wallet (pending acceptance) which can contain malicious code, abusive messages, unsolicited dick pics, etc.</p>

                        Every coin is designed to be inherently finite. The original pitch with Bitcoin is that it would mimic gold. There's a bunch of gold that's basically laying out in the open in rivers, then shallow veins, deep veins, and sub-oceanic veins. Over time it gets harder to get more gold</p>

                        So every coin is designed to get harder and harder to get over time. But the release rate is *crafted*, and there is a hard cap that it asymptotically approaches. The (hilariously IP infringing) CryptoGwent has a fixed supply that trickles out over 3 years. https://t.co/yb8VvN8GyB</p>

                        What happens, and what has long been a selling point of crypto, is that as time goes on the theoretical purchasing power of a single coin goes up (and up and up and up). This is the whole "if you bought 1 BTC when mining was cheap it's worth sooooo much now" line.</p>

                        This is also part of the environmental cost. Proof-of-work is leveraged against the electricity required to solve the increasingly complex equations that enforce the asymptotic mining schedule.</p>

                        The result, by design, is strictly deflationary, which has two hallmarks: currency will always be harder to get tomorrow than today, and the price of goods and labour will inevitably be cheaper.</p>

                        Now, if you're an early adopter or someone with vast reserves of currency this is in your favour. Your stockpile gives you more and more and more purchasing power as things get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.</p>

                        If you're at the bottom, if you do not have reserves and have to earn-and-spend every month, this sucks.

If you have to take on debt as a necessity (vs as an asset) it quadruple sucks.</p>

                        Anything you buy with that debt that can't be leveraged will definitionally be worth less than what you pay for it. Your interest will make your debt go up while your ability to earn to pay it off goes down.</p>

                        The basic loop is this: crops require 42 interactions to harvest, and players can interact every 4 hours. If you miss two consecutive interactions you're penalized 1 interaction for every missed timer thereafter.</p>

                        42 interactions on a 4 hour timer, 7 straight days of clicking every 4 hours, day or night. If you go absent up to 11 hours at once then you're merely extending that to 7 days + 11 hours. At 12 hours you're docked a point and effectively lose 4 hours in addition to the real time.</p>

                        The idea is that because of the promise of profit people buy in for steep prices but rarely cash out; all their "earnings" (paid in scrip) are redirected into buying more in-game plots/cows/crops, and the owners get to skim on every transaction.</p>

                        This makes it easy to create the illusion of value and return: it took months and months but you've gone from 1 $5000 cow to 4 $5000 cows! You've got $20,000! But you don't. You have stock, that doesn't mean you have buyers.</p>

                        The entire concept of MetaMask is such an unmitigated nightmare, I don't know why anyone would trust it.

I legitimately do not understand how any artist, musician, or videographer who has worked on the web could even start to rationalize it.</p>

                        Like, the problems that MetaMask (and competitors) exist to solve is first that every game, dapp, defi scam, and DAO has their own coin and/or chain that you need to deal with if you want to be involved in the ecosystem, so managing them becomes a nightmare.</p>

                        And second is that in order for any regular-ass website to talk to "on-chain" stuff there needs to be a protocol for the two to talk to each other.</p>

                        Now, months ago I saw some absolutely unhinged raving about how MetaMask finally solves the single-login problem in a way that Facebook and Google never managed to, and just, like, have we learned nothing?</p>

                        Like, within the concept space of crypto, in their own mental model, MetaMask is effectively like logging into every random ass forum using your bank account, driver's license, credit card number, and the pink slip to your car at the same time.</p>

                        The thing we learned about single-log in isn't that it lets Ol' Zuck know a wee bit too much about you, it's that it creates an enormous point of failure where one mistake with a less-than-trustworthy handshake compromises every single connected service you use.</p>

                        And that's not all! Even just the fact that a wallet manager is necessary because common practice is already to maintain multiple different wallets of the same kind purely to obfuscate your activity because it turns out an immutable blockchain makes it super easy to spy on you.</p>
