<blockquote data-conversation="none" class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My question about a blockchain&#39;s political system would be &quot;how does it work once market choice has calcified?&quot; And to what degree has that already happened with bitcoin (never hard forks) and ethereum (closely follows dev governance). 18/</p>&mdash; Paul Frazee✌️ (@pfrazee) <a href="https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/1479498719305379843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2022</a></blockquote>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Even under a &quot;calcified market,&quot; there&#39;s still pressure to avoid a mass exit by users.

<blockquote data-conversation="none" class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So maybe the way to analyze a blockchain&#39;s political system is to assume that market choice is calcified, and therefore doesn&#39;t represent a significant part of the process. 20/</p>&mdash; Paul Frazee✌️ (@pfrazee) <a href="https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/1479498723206078464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2022</a></blockquote>

                        You would probably need to do some pretty deep analysis on each chain to get clear answers. Ethereum, for instance, has the idea of "difficulty bombs" on the "dead chains," though I can't find if that's ever been used or now will be used. 6/</p>

                        There are also outside pressures which Lyn discusses, such as stablecoins. If your ecosystem depends on a stablecoin for trade and USD redemption, and the stablecoin declares a specific fork as THE fork, then you might have to go with their choice. 7/</p>

                        As far as I can tell, "bitcoin" has never undergone an intentional hard fork. All of the upgrades (like SegWit and Taproot) have been soft forks, meaning they can be ignored without splitting the network. 8/</p>

                        It's not yet clear to me exactly why Ethereum has had "upgrade hard forks" but bitcoin hasn't. Lyn points at some reasons in the article, but I'm struggling to reduce it further than "culture." The btc community doesn't want hard fork upgrades; the eth community does. 9/</p>

                        If a blockchain rule-change is equivalent to a hard fork, which is semi-equivalent to a new chain, then the social/political consensus-making around the "canonical chain" is more significant than I suggested in my first thread. 10/</p>

                        ...which sort of bothers me because it's hard to analyze those processes. If a chain has dev governance, that governance ultimately produces a codebase, so there's some kind of "political branch" which is the sum of all impl repos and the people who can push to them. 11/</p>

                        Market choice can be a suitable answer for distributed decision-making / political systems. It's flexible, it doesn't require a lot of formal speccing or implementation, and it distributes choice widely. 14/</p>

                        Market choice can also be hard to predict or analyze, and does run the risk of monopoly captures -- which is what I think stablecoins and exchanges represent. 15/</p>

                        Network effects are a huge pressure for any shared resource that requires an ongoing relationship with the resource, as is the case for a currency you hold, a smart contract executor, a DAO platform, or a social network. 16/</p>

                        And I would guess, based on what I've seen and read, that as a blockchain ecosystem stabilizes then the willingness of market participants to exercise their choice will decrease, making it a much less effective mechanism.

                        My question about a blockchain's political system would be "how does it work once market choice has calcified?" And to what degree has that already happened with bitcoin (never hard forks) and ethereum (closely follows dev governance). 18/</p>

                        Even under a "calcified market," there's still pressure to avoid a mass exit by users. That makes it a very coarse-grained political mechanism compared to, say, being involved in core protocol governance. 19/</p>

                        So maybe the way to analyze a blockchain's political system is to assume that market choice is calcified, and therefore doesn't represent a significant part of the process. 20/</p>

                        Well, it's a fascinating topic. I suggest reading Lyn's full piece at https://t.co/3HIloi3Pry. It makes many other interesting observations, including a number of criticisms of Ethereum and Proof of Stake, which are well worth reading. 21/21</p>
