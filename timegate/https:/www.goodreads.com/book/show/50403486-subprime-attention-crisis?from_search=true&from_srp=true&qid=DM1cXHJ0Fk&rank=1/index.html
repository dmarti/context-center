What he does here is much more interesting. I know we particularly like doomsday predictions – but while he does point to a series of problems with the way the internet currently runs, and discusses the implications of what could happen if things turned out badly, this book is much more interesting than just providing a prophet of doom. It forces us to think about how and why the internet is currently structured as it is. And this structuring of the internet deserves our attention, not just because it might all suddenly collapse, but because how it is currently structured might not be how we would prefer it to be structured.</p><p>A large part of this book is based in the idea that the internet we currently have is a result of people simply don’t want to pay for the internet – at least, not directly. That means that the internet is paid for by advertising. But why would advertises want to fund the internet rather than, say, newspapers, billboards, films or magazines? Well, a very large part of that reason is because the internet offers something other media can’t offer. That is, measurable audience attention. Sites like Google, Facebook and Good Reads require you to enter information about yourself before you can access the features of these sites. Then they track every damn thing you do – often not just on their site, but on every other site too. Then they sell advertising that is directed at you, according to both the wants you know you have – given you have just searched for the best drone to buy or a reasonably priced divorce lawyer or a particularly flavoursome vanilla ice cream – or wants you might have if you were nudged hard enough, given the preferences you might not even know you might have, but that seven-out-of-ten divorced drone pilots who eat vanilla ice cream share.</p><p>We are so used to the standard ideas about the internet knowing us better than we know ourselves that we might find it hard to believe that perhaps this all-seeing eye could possibly not be nearly as all-seeing as we think. I am certainly a victim of this type of prejudice. But if this book is one thing, it is a bit of a curative. </p><p>Again, the book isn’t saying that all of our fears about capitalist surveillance have been overhyped, although, that is clearly part of the message. Rather, the author discusses the problems with the way advertising is sold on the web. One of these problems is that those who sell advertising have a clear and obvious interest in hyping the potential of their ability to provide attentive eyeballs to advertisements. But sometimes they stretch credibility. For instance, at one point in this the author mentions that Facebook promised to provide more young people of a certain age in the US than the census said existed. </p><p>Another part of the problem is that an increasing number of people are using ad-blocking software. So, even if Google knows you want to kill your granny given your recent history of search and WhatsApp messages, their ad for cheap rat poison suppliers might never end up be seen by you, even though it is exactly the right ad you need to see. </p><p>Then there is the problem of bots that flit about the internet ‘generating traffic’ but, since they aren’t conscious, they generate numbers ‘views’ of ads that aren’t really anything of a sort. At one point in this book the author says that over half of all ads on the internet might never have actually been seen by a human. And then there are ‘fat fingers’ – where you mistakenly tap an ad on your phone that you actually had no intention of tapping, except scrolling and tapping can all too easily look like the same thing.</p><p>Even so, let’s pretend you are a human and you don’t have ad-blocking software on your computer – does that mean you actually see and register the banner ads on display on your favourite website? Sometimes Facebook asks me if I’ve seen an ad by some company or other they have presumably displayed for me over the last couple of days. I never answer these requests, since it is in the least bit clear what possible benefit there could be for me in answering these questions, other than in helping a company that makes a fortune out of selling my attention to find better ways to market shit I don’t need at me. The fact is that I don’t think I’ve ever remembered seeing any of the ads they mention. </p><p>Sometimes I think this is part of the trick – you know, they are trying to see if I’m being honest with them and so they ask me about a penis enlargement ad they never actually displayed. Kind of a clever double pike with a twist – where there was no penis enlargement ad, but now I’m still thinking I need to get on to enlarging my penis anyway. Of course, penis enlargement might well be so front-of-mind that I might think I must have seen an ad for it over the last few days anyway. We all like to believe advertising only works on other people – I have to admit that I’m much more likely to believe advertising might well work best when we don’t notice we are aware of ads. </p><p>I remember hearing someone from the Evil Murdoch Empire™ saying that people (although, it is unlikely he would have referred to us as people – maybe something like ‘potentially viable though currently inactive target consumer marketing units’ – should be forced to make cups of tea and to go the toilet during television program times, rather than ad breaks, as skipping the ads is a form of theft. Clearly, the only advantage of the Trump wall along the border with Mexico is that it will be sufficiently long to save the revolution from the stress of working out which of these bastards needs to be first put up against it. </p><p>The book provides more than enough information on how advertising on the internet is sold and how it is variously manipulated by players, not least so as to push up its price. The book details how dark pools exist so that the lack of reliable information and transparency means that speculation around the price of advertising becomes inevitable and that this could eventually lead to a ‘subprime’ crisis where companies realise they are not getting the value they are paying for and then pull the plug on the gushing revenue stream that funds much of what happens on the web. That this might then make a ‘user pays’ model to fund the web inevitable. Such a shift would make the internet virtually unavailable for large numbers of current users. This would result in a massive loss of faith in the current value of advertising on the internet – but a large part of the point of this book is to call into question the basis upon which that faith is based. </p><p>The book begins with a discussion on a presentation the author saw at an advertising conference in which an academic researcher provided the results of their research showing that a lot of digital advertising was worse than useless – it’s more expensive than ‘non-targeted’ advertising, and often only impacts people who were about to buy your product anyway. But when the researcher finished his talk and asked if there were any questions, there were literally none – and the following session was yet another hype-and-spin on the joys of targeted advertising. </p><p>Like I said, even if this book proves to be wildly off in everything it predicts – I would still recommend you read it. It’s short, it’s clearly written, and it makes otherwise difficult topics clear and accessible. Even if there proves to never be a subprime attention crisis, at the very least this book will make it clear what those words mean and why seeing them strung together in that order should concern us. </p></span>

  <span id="freeText8073442254813089544">The internet has morphed through numerous stages to get to the current advertising model. Tim Hwang says that global model is so corrupt and corrupted it looks like the stock markets just before the Financial Crisis and recession of 2008. “The whole edifice of online advertising…is bunk,” he says. In his Subprime Attention Crisis, he explores the many ways it doesn’t work.<p>The whole raison d’être of the world wide web seems to be personal data collection and surveillance. Hwang says the data collected is laughable. Ten percent of the records have some data that is wrong, and as many as 85% are just plain wrong altogether. In a world where garbage in means garbage out, decisions made on this data are worthless at best. Yet they are the pride of the internet: it’s shining difference.</p><p>It was supposed to be so highly targeted there would be no waste. For users, it meant ads speaking directly to them, based on sites they had visited, things they had purchased, and chats they had posted. For marketers, it meant finally knowing which half of the money they were spending on advertising was wasted, while improving the closing of sales because no effort was being inefficient. Turns out almost all the money spent on website ads is wasted. Users are not clicking or buying, and pinpoint targeting fails repeatedly.</p><p>Compounding this disaster is the structure of ad placement itself, which has evolved from direct negotiation with various sites, to middlemen placing the ads for a fee. The problem is those middlemen are raking off a 70% cut, leaving the site with just 30% of the revenue from showing ads on their services. Sooner or later, Hwang says, both advertisers and their host sites will wake up to the ripoff. The result might be the complete destruction of the model and a whole new beginning for the internet.</p><p>The way it works now is that two kinds of middlemen meet to place ads. One aggregator represents the sell side, with an inventory of empty slots on various sites. On the buy side are the advertisers who want pinpoint placement to take advantage of the internet’s supposed power to target individuals precisely. </p><p>When someone lands on a page, the buy side and the sell side get together in an instant auction, placing some client firm’s ad on that page. The firm bought into that placement being precisely what it wanted: the right user landing in the right spot, interested and ready to purchase the firm’s product. </p><p>Nothing could be further from the truth, and sales results prove it daily.</p><p>Not only is the personal data wrong, but far from being of interest to the user, ads are all but totally ignored. When they began in the id-90s, ads were so new, people clicked on them out of curiosity. The clickthrough rate was an astonishing 44%, convincing many firms that the internet was where to place their marketing dollars. Today, the clickthrough rate less than one half of one percent, making it a worse buy that most other media. People are sick of ads, don’t want the distraction of clicking away from what they were doing and often resent the ads that come closest to actually being of importance to them. It is too creepy to have an ad know exactly what you want.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the process itself, marketers’ ads end up costing far more than they thought they would in the instant auction process. They pay more and get less exposure than they paid for. Some ads get placed at the bottom of the page, where the user might never scroll to before clicking away. As many as 56% of online ads are never seen by a human, just because of bad placement. Some end up on pages that are merely there to collect ad revenue and have no content. Some are fraudulent clicks made by bots. And of course, both bots and paid humans click away on the ads themselves to boost the (fake) results and thereby convince the sucker, er, marketer, to keep buying that space on that page. More than half of inventory is lost to click fraud or unviewable inventory. Hwang says it is “a massive global economy of fraud in the programmatic advertising marketplace. “ 51</p><p>But wait! There’s more. Users have taken matters into their own hands too. Free ad-blocking software has been installed on hundreds of millions of devices. Browsers themselves now come equipped with automatic ad blockers. Estimates are that 75% of North Americans use some sort of ad blocking, so they never see an ad at all.</p><p>How long before the marketers wake up? How long before they admit their ads are not being seen, never mind being clicked by a highly reliable and curated potential customer? How long before the marketers rebel at the absurdly high cost per ad in the totally opaque and untraceable process of purchasing an ad space? What could possibly go wrong with this infrastructure setup?</p><p>While consumers might rejoice at the ripoff of advertisers and their failure to increase sales or even be noticed at all, there is a very dark side to the joy. The whole web has arisen on the back of the ad model. Everything that is free on the internet is supported by revenue from ads. Without the marketers ‘ money greasing their engines – even if it is just 30% of the final auction price – millions of services worldwide will quickly starve to death.</p><p>Hwang uses the buy and sell siders’ own words to show how closely the ad system tacks to the stock markets. He quotes numerous firms’ executives describing their auction systems as paralleling the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ markets. It seems they are just as blind and vulnerable as those markets, which took a decade to recover from the Financial Crisis they allowed to overtake them in 2008. But in this case, they might not come back at all. They are not institutions, but weak new companies with shallow pockets and no roots.</p><p>It will mean a completely different kind of World Wide Web going forward. It might be subscription based, or perhaps services will be entirely sponsored by one firm. Or something completely different. The main point is a huge disaster is looming. No one is preparing for it, and no one knows what will replace the current system. This portends turmoil like the web has never experienced.</p><p>If you had to pay for twitter, would you? If you had to pay for every Google search, would you? Of the dozens of free services you now use, how many could you even afford to pay for?</p><p>So don’t get comfortable with your lovely set of highly focused bookmarks. All those sites are as fragile as the newspapers and magazines they so easily displaced. The internet as we know it might have the shortest lifespan of any medium to date.</p><p>David Wineberg<br>Author, The Straight Dope, or What I learned from my first thousand nonfiction reviews</p></span>

That is, the marketers overhype what the technology can do, and the rest of us are eating it right up. (Anyone who's worked at a startup gets it: Engineering is always playing catch-up to Sales's promises.) His book, then, is a case study about why taking these claims at face value is not only gullible, but a threat to the health and stability of our digital economy.<p>Hwang argues that the modern digital ad market is on its way to becoming a bubble, much like the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. Today, consumers ignore ads, Facebook and Google hide behind opaque, self-serving definitions of "views" and "conversions," and everything from overt fraud (click farms) to clever accounting (Facebook's overstatement of video views) runs rampant. It feels like everyone, from the digital marketers to the industry researchers, has a perverse incentive to act like digital ads work better than they do, despite study after peer-reviewed study questioning this assumption.</p><p>Hwang is also a fantastic econ teacher—and I'm saying this as someone who had no idea how the 2008 financial crisis worked until last summer. He breaks down the programmatic ad market step by step, walks you through its similarities to the mortgage market of the late aughts, then provides numbered suggestions to reform the system—all in a tight little 178-page volume. With clever analogies (e.g. one unit of attention: one fictionalized Standardized Chicken Lot) and a clear-cut narrative structure, you won't need a pre-existing passion for two-sided market design to get something out of this read.</p><p>By the end of the book, Hwang starts describing the social consequences of having the whole Internet—from journalism to Google Maps—run on ad dollars: surveillance capitalism, addictive feeds, political polarization. Each of his carefully numbered arguments builds toward a picture of the ad industry as an increasingly precarious house of cards, so it's no surprise that he concludes that "Rather than trying to fix a broken market, we should work toward a controlled demolition that reduces its influence in the long run." Hwang ends by proposing a few of these possible reforms, such as industry-independent research organizations, mandatory disclosures for vendors of programmatic ads, and legal teeth to punish frauds.</p><p>Overall, I found Subprime Attention Crisis persuasive, if mildly hyperbolic: the narrow reforms proposed in the last few pages don't seem to match the urgency of the the crisis-like descriptions of the first three-quarters. In my opinion, the bigger challenge of the next 5 or 10 years—and what I'm most interested in asking Hwang about next Thursday—is how we'll actually wean the web off ads and toward something more sustainable.</p><p><i>reviewed for the <a href="https://reboothq.substack.com/p/hwang" rel="nofollow noopener">reboot newsletter</a> - come to our <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/reboot-subprime-attention-crisis-ft-tim-hwang-registration-145501467807" rel="nofollow noopener">q&amp;a on the book</a> on 3/18!</i></p></span>

But this title caught my eye as I browsed Netgalley. Internet advertising has a significant impact on anyone reading this. We all see it (even when we diligently use an adblocker). Maybe you have advertising on your blog. Most importantly: we all depend on it as the foundation that supports how the Internet currently functions.</p><p>Hwang argues that ineffective internet advertising has built up around inaccurate and unreliable metrics. I thought I knew the basics of how internet advertising works. I learnt a lot more about it from this book. These metrics, along with other factors that Hwang explores, mean the system is poised to fail as the markets did in 2008. As the title implies, Hwang draws comparisons throughout the book to the subprime mortgage crisis. Internet advertising faces a ‘subprime attention crisis’. Why should we care about the potential failure of online advertising, which for most of us is little more than an irritant? Because it’s currently the key that allows us to freely access websites and the information contained within. Hwang concludes with broad suggestions of how the industry might anticipate such a failure and begin to mitigate it.</p><p>The nature of Hwang’s subject lends itself to mildly technical language. It reminded me of reading textbooks in university. I can understand the topic generally, but I need to focus to really comprehend what he’s telling me. Finally, I understand the 2008 mortgage crisis, haha. I had to look it up in order to understand Hwang’s comparison.</p><p><b>💭 The Bottom Line:</b> <i>Subprime Attention Crisis</i> may require focused attention from a layperson to comprehend, but its relatively short length and important topic make it a good read for anyone who cares about the long term sustainability of the Internet as we know it.</p></span>

  <span id="freeText2758920715284073645">In Subprime Attention Crisis, Tim Hwang initiates an upsetting conversation about not only the relationship of social media to advertising (which latter supports social media and causes it to remain free) but about the possibility that the many free services that enable internet users to explore products and news were suddenly behind a paywall. It could happen. If advertising is contingent upon the public having free access, how far down would sales be driven by the abrupt necessity to pay for each service, much as one pays for TV programming services? It does not take too many pages--or paragraphs--for the author to draw the reader's attention to the fact that the online advertising edifice is a wobbly thing. The description of the algorithm-driven process by which programmatic advertising takes place is very damaging to the confidence of anyone counting on such advertising to boost sales.. Hwang's description, best suited to understanding by familiarized online advertising experts, goes some distance in helping readers grasp the (lack of) logic behind the advertisements they see. This book seems to be an important study in online marketing and its interconnection with the rest of the global economy. Marketing teachers would do well to consider choosing Subprime Attention Crisis for their classes, if for nothing else than critical thinking and planning. #SubprimeAttentionCrisis #NetGalley</span>

The answer is surprisingly simple: much of the blame can be put on the programmatic advertising. The history of how it happened is explained in detail in another book I am currently reading and highly recommend, "The Tangled Web We Weave" by James Ball, while Tim Hwang is more focused on its actual mechanisms. The main argument of this book is a convincing parallel to financial markets and the 2008 crisis. Moreover, in the spirit of "solution journalism," the author advises on how to avoid the explosion of the "subprime" attention bubble. It can be a bit challenging read for someone who isn't much into financial issues, but it is worth the effort.<p>The book is a part of a very interesting series, FSG Original x Logic, which dissects the way technology functions in everyday lives. </p><p>Thanks to the publisher, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and NetGalley for an advanced copy of this book.</p></span>

I just didn't feel particularly moved by the book. The kind of crux of the book is a comparison between the 2008 financial crash and the bubble of advertising. Lots of parallels to be drawn there for sure. Advertising is such a weird thing in how success is measured (or not) and the vast amounts of money poured into it. The author is right that there are problems to be fixed and it's not great for so many things (search, news, videos) to be totally dependent on advertising. But at the same time, I just don't see a drop in advertising prices as something that will happen overnight or have as many negative impacts as proposed. Sure people said the same thing about the shit mortgages in 2008 but until banks are baking loans with CDOs where the collateral is ad space I don't think the pops will play out the same way.</p><p>Decent book though and if you don't know much about online ads give it a whirl.</p></span>

Same goes for fraudulent clicks and non-visible impressions - we know how to work with it here in 2021. <p>The book has a fascinating and engaging premise, but barely scratches the surface of exploring the real depth of the problem.</p><p>NB: The cover deserves full 5 start though.</p></span>

Yet, they keep finding new ways to inject ads. Like inline videos. Spoken in the middle of podcasts. It's an arms race, the efficiencies will work themselves out, as large companies wax and wane their marketing budgets. The solutions of government control seem far fetched.

  <span id="freeText5023886724717495425">I will never forget the new hire orientation on my first day of work at <i>[An Unnamed Major Tech Company]</i> back in 2014. During orientation, a popular executive extolled the virtues of targeted online advertising, both for businesses and for the people lucky enough to see these amazing targeted ads.<p>“We can show people ads for things that are actually relevant to them!” the executive declared. “Wouldn’t you prefer to see ads for things you actually want?”</p><p>“No,” I remember thinking, “I would rather just not see ads at all.”</p><p>But this idea, that people hate ads and don’t want them invading every moment of their consciousness, is never part of the discourse at places like <i>[An Unnamed Major Tech Company]</i>. It is taken as gospel that advertising is good, and that carefully targeted advertising is even better.</p><p>This book tries to dispel those assumptions–and many more that dominate the world of online advertising. And if what this book says is true, these are some very troubling assumptions indeed. For one thing, online advertising apparently reached peak engagement with banner ads in the 1990s and hasn’t gotten anywhere close to that since. Turns out most people just don’t want to be bothered by ads. Shocking, right?</p><p>For another thing, highly targeted advertising may not even be very effective at two of its main objectives: (1) getting eyeballs on it and (2) getting people to buy stuff. From the ubiquity of ad blocking software to the rise of click farms and ad fraud, billions of dollars in ads are bought, paid for, and seen by no one at all. This coupled with the pervasive opacity of how targeted online ads work, how they are priced, and where they appear means that the whole digital ads ecosystem, according to this book, is rife with abuse and poised to pop in a big (and very bad) way. </p><p>The author draws compelling parallels between the state of online ads today and the state of mortgages in 2008, another bubble that popped in a big and bad way. I don’t know enough about this topic to dispute any of the author’s claims. Perhaps he is wrong and things aren’t as calamitous as they seem. I can’t really argue this. But I read a similarly engaging and well-researched article on this topic by Cory Doctorow a few years ago. There is a growing chorus of voices warning that online ads are a precarious bubble waiting to burst—and take a good chunk of the economy down with them. This book definitely felt like another “oh shit” moment in a steady stream of “oh shit” moments that made me want to sell my tech stock and diversify my portfolio before stuff hits the fan.</p><p>If we accept that online ads are not as effective as they seem, and in fact their adoption and pervasiveness are mostly driven by hot air and hype, how do we prevent them from tanking and causing another recession a la 2008? The author calls for better regulations and transparency around the cost and effectiveness of online ads, so that advertisers aren’t paying unpredictable prices for some vague thing. He also advocates for more independent research into the ads industry, again aimed at increasing transparency and knowledge about the actual value of online ads so they’re priced in accordance with what they are actually worth.</p><p>These are both perfectly okay solutions, I suppose, but they didn’t get me super fired up about the possibility of actual change. I have a feeling this is a bubble that is going to explode before regulators get around to doing anything about it, as so many people have a huge economic stake in pretending that targeted advertising is the best thing since antibiotics, even if it performs markedly worse than a banner ad from 1997. For my own part, I would prefer an internet that is completely free of ads, even though, as the author points out, that would make many services unaffordable for most people. I’d like to see more of the internet be publicly funded as a public good, rather than propped up by hungry capitalists looking to sell things. Perhaps the author is right that a “controlled demolition” of the digital ads market can eventually give rise to a more equitable and transparent internet that isn’t choked by ads. But I’m skeptical this will happen, and I would have liked the author to explore in more detail what an internet without advertising could look like. </p><p>Overall, this was a great book and a very quick read. Short, sweet, compellingly argued, and gave me a lot to think about.</p></span>

With clear and precise language, Hwang describes the savings glut hypothesis, NINJA loans, and CDOS (though it definitely helps to have some background knowledge, go watch The Big Short or something before reading this book). And it turns out that all the market failures, fraud, and perverse incentives that led to the subprime housing bubble map on quite cleanly onto the programmatic advertising market.</p><p>The internet is run on ads. Programmatic advertising is a huge chunk of Google, Facebook, and all of news media's revenue streams. All online platforms are designed to render its users legible through profiles, likes, and shares so that their attention can be commodified into a "18-24 year old, Asian male, interested in economics."</p><p>This is a swift 150-page book. Hwang lays out a clear and ambitious argument for all the ways that online advertising is horrendously overvalued, how the underlying asset of our attention spans is crap, all the different ways to defraud online advertisers, and the market incentives that want us all to look the other way. I often find myself at the end of one chapter thinking "But what about this?" and seeing his next chapter address just that. </p><p>The most provocative part of the book is his push for us to imagine an internet that is not mediated around selling our attention. I'm writing this review on Goodreads where I have a profile, rate books, and build to-read lists as the platform is showing me an ad of Sephora beauty products and probably is collecting my personal data for its parent company Amazon. The incentive to attract attention is so baked in where even I, a consumer who makes no profit using this site, write with the hopes of getting the one or two likes from my Goodreads friends. </p><p>What would a book-based social media site look like if it were removed from the attention economy? Would people leave more heartfelt reviews? Would we be doing communal reads sessions? I don't know, but we should probably think of something before all these "free" internet services go belly up and can no longer sell us as the product.</p><p>The only area where the book falls short is in the solutions it provides. Hwang offers level-headed but also bland solutions like a third-party think tank/watchdog and government regulation to help deflate the bubble. Yet at the same time, he encourages a more radical imagination for what we would like the internet to be. What does the appetite for ad spending say about an economy built around overconsumption? What does a de-commodification of attention look like? Finding solutions through these questions may be a bit utopian but are still worth exploring heeding his provocation.</p><p>Hwang cites a quote by the retailer Wanamaker: "I'm wasting half my money on advertising, the trouble is I don't know which half." Subprime Attention Crisis shows that we're wasting a whole lot more than half and we better figure out what to do before it all comes crashing down.</p></span>

            <span>“There are good reasons to believe that online advertising inventory is steadily decreasing in value over time. Two forces drive this erosion of value: structural shifts in what people pay attention to, and a massive global economy of fraud in the programmatic advertising marketplace. These trends are hidden by the murkiness of online advertising, as well as by a pattern of bad incentives that encourage ongoing efforts to pump up and hype the market.”</span>
