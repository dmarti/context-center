   <p>When designing new features for the Web platform,
we must always consider the security and privacy implications of our work.
New Web features should always
maintain or enhance
the overall security and privacy of the Web.</p>
   <p>This document contains a set of questions
intended to help <abbr title="specification">spec</abbr> authors
as they think through
the security and privacy implications
of their work and write the narrative Security Considerations and Privacy
Considerations sections for inclusion in-line in their specifications,
as described below in <a href="#considerations">§ 2.15 Does this specification have both "Security Considerations" and "Privacy
  Considerations" sections?</a>.
It also documents mitigation strategies
that spec authors can use to address

   <p>This document is itself a work in progress,
and there may be security or privacy concerns
which this document does not (yet) cover.
Please <a href="https://github.com/w3ctag/security-questionnaire/issues/new">let us know</a> if you identify a security or privacy concern

   <h3 data-level="1.1" id="howtouse"><span>1.1. </span><span>How To Use The Questionnaire</span><a href="#howtouse"></a></h3>
   <p>Work through these questions
early on in the design process,
when things are easier to change.
When privacy and security issues are only found later,
after a feature has shipped,
it’s much harder to change the design.
If security or privacy issues are found late,
user agents may need to adopt breaking changes
to fix the issues.</p>
   <p>Keep these questions in mind while working on specifications.
Periodically revisit this questionnaire and continue to consider the questions,
particularly as a design changes over time.</p>

   <p>When answering this question, please consider each of these four possible
areas of information disclosure / sharing.</p>
   <p>For the below sub-questions,
please take the term <em>potentially identifying information</em> to mean information that describes the browser user,
distinct from others who use the same browser version.
Examples of such <em>potentially identifying information</em> include information
about the browser user’s environment (e.g., operating system configuration,
browser configuration, hardware capabilities), and the user’s prior activities
and interests (e.g., browsing history, purchasing preferences, personal
characteristics).</p>

mitigated the risk by reducing a policy’s granularity after a redirect. </p>
   <h3 data-level="2.3" id="personal-data"><span>2.3. </span><span> How do the features in your specification deal with personal information,
  personally-identifiable information (PII), or information derived from
  them? </span><a href="#personal-data"></a></h3>
   <p>Personal information is any data about a user
(for example, their home address),
or information that could be used to identify a user,
such as an alias, email address, or identification number.</p>
   <p role="note"><span>Note:</span> Personal information is
distinct from personally identifiable information
(<abbr title="personally identifiable information">PII</abbr>).
PII is a legal concept,
the definition of which varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
When used in a non-legal context,
PII tends to refer generally
to information
that could be used to identify a user.</p>
   <p>When exposing
personal information, PII, or derivative information,
spec authors must take steps to minimize the potential harm to users.</p>
   <p id="example-1d75986f"><a href="#example-1d75986f"></a> A feature
which gathers biometric data
(such as fingerprints or retina scans)
for authentication
should not directly expose this biometric data to the web.
Instead,
it can use the biometric data
to look up or generate some temporary key which is not shared across origins
which can then be safely exposed to the origin. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-webauthn">[WEBAUTHN]</a> </p>
   <p>Personal information, PII, or their derivatives
should not be exposed to origins
without <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#consent">meaningful user consent</a>.
Many APIs
use the Permissions API to acquire meaningful user consent. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-permissions">[PERMISSIONS]</a></p>
   <p>Keep in mind
that each permission prompt
added to the web platform
increases the risk
that users will ignore
the contents of all permission prompts.
Before adding a permission prompt, consider your options for using
a less obtrusive way to gain meaningful user consent. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-adding-permission">[ADDING-PERMISSION]</a></p>
   <p id="example-e2335d65"><a href="#example-e2335d65"></a> <code>&lt;input type=file&gt;</code> can be used to upload
documents containing personal information
to websites.
It makes use of
the underlying native platform’s file picker
to ensure the user understands
that the file and its contents
will be exposed to the website,
without a separate permissions prompt. </p>

   <h3 data-level="2.4" id="sensitive-data"><span>2.4. </span><span> How do the features in your specification deal with sensitive information? </span><a href="#sensitive-data"></a></h3>
   <p>Personal information is not the only kind of sensitive information.
Many other kinds of information may also be sensitive.
What is or isn’t sensitive information can vary
from person to person
or from place to place.
Information that would be harmless if known about
one person or group of people
could be dangerous if known about
another person or group.
Information about a person
that would be harmless in one country
might be used in another country
to detain, kidnap, or imprison them.</p>
   <p>Examples of sensitive information include:
caste,
citizenship,
color,
credentials,
criminal record,
demographic information,
disability status,
employment status,
ethnicity,
financial information,
health information,
location data,
marital status,
political beliefs,
profession,
race,
religious beliefs or nonbeliefs,
sexual preferences,
and
trans status.</p>
   <p>When a feature exposes sensitive information to the web,
its designers must take steps
to mitigate the risk of exposing the information.</p>
   <div id="example-faf2460c">
    <p>The Credential Management API allows sites
to request a user’s credentials
from a password manager. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-credential-management-1">[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT-1]</a> If it exposed the user’s credentials to JavaScript,
and if the page using the API were vulnerable to <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#cross-site-scripting-attacks" id="ref-for-cross-site-scripting-attacks">XSS</a> attacks,
the user’s credentials could be leaked to attackers.</p>
    <p>The Credential Management API
mitigates this risk
by not exposing the credentials to JavaScript.
Instead, it exposes
an opaque <code><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#formdata" id="ref-for-formdata">FormData</a></code> object
which cannot be read by JavaScript.
The spec also recommends
that sites configure Content Security Policy <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-csp">[CSP]</a> with reasonable <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#connect-src" id="ref-for-connect-src">connect-src</a> and <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#form-action" id="ref-for-form-action">form-action</a> values
to further mitigate the risk of exfiltration.</p>
   </div>
   <p>Many use cases
which require location information
can be adequately served
with very coarse location data.
For instance,
a site which recommends restaurants
could adequately serve its users
with city-level location information
instead of exposing the user’s precise location.</p>

   <h3 data-level="2.5" id="persistent-origin-specific-state"><span>2.5. </span><span> Do the features in your specification introduce new state for an origin
  that persists across browsing sessions? </span><a href="#persistent-origin-specific-state"></a></h3>
   <p>There are many existing mechanisms
origins can use to
store information about a user.
Cookies, <code>ETag</code>, <code>Last Modified</code>, <code><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#dom-localstorage" id="ref-for-dom-localstorage">localStorage</a></code>,
and <code><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/#dom-windoworworkerglobalscope-indexeddb" id="ref-for-dom-windoworworkerglobalscope-indexeddb">indexedDB</a></code> are just a few examples.</p>
   <p>Allowing an origin
to store data
on a user’s device
in a way that persists across browsing sessions
introduces the risk
that this state may be used
to track a user
without their knowledge or control,
either in <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://privacycg.github.io/storage-access/#first-party-site-context" id="ref-for-first-party-site-context">first-</a> or <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://privacycg.github.io/storage-access/#third-party-context" id="ref-for-third-party-context">third-party</a> contexts.</p>
   <p>One of the ways
user agents mitigate the risk
that client-side storage mechanisms
will form a persistent identifier
is by providing users with the ability
to clear out the data stored by origins.
New state persistence mechanisms
should not be introduced
without mitigations
to prevent them
from being used
to track users
across domains
or without control
over clearing this state.
That said,
manually clearing storage
is something users do only rarely.
Spec authors should consider ways
to make new features more privacy-preserving without full storage clearing,
such as
reducing the uniqueness of values,
rotating values,
or otherwise making features no more identifying than is needed.
Also, keep in mind that
user agents make use of several different caching mechanisms.
Which, if any, caches will store this new state?
Are additional mitigations necessary?</p>
   <div id="example-c6a8651b">
    <p>Service Workers
intercept all requests made by an origin,
which enables sites
to continue to function when the browser goes offline.
Because of this,
a maliciously-injected service worker
could compromise the user (as documented in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers-1/#security-considerations"><cite>Service Workers</cite> § 6 Security Considerations</a>).</p>
    <p>The spec mitigates the risks
an <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#active-network-attacker" id="ref-for-active-network-attacker">active network attacker</a> or <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#cross-site-scripting-attacks" id="ref-for-cross-site-scripting-attacks①">XSS</a> vulnerability present

   <p id="example-32a45432"><a href="#example-32a45432"></a> Platform-specific DRM implementations

might expose origin-specific information
in order to help identify users
and determine whether they ought to be granted access
to a specific piece of media.
These kinds of identifiers
should be carefully evaluated
to determine how abuse can be mitigated;
identifiers which a user cannot easily change
are very valuable from a tracking perspective,
and protecting such identifiers
from an <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#active-network-attacker" id="ref-for-active-network-attacker①">active network attacker</a> is vital. </p>
   <h3 data-level="2.6" id="underlying-platform-data"><span>2.6. </span><span> Do the features in your specification expose information about the
  underlying platform to origins? </span><a href="#underlying-platform-data"></a></h3>
   <p>(Underlying platform information includes
user configuration data,
the presence and attributes of hardware I/O devices such as sensors,
and the availability and behavior of various software features.)</p>
   <p>If so, is the same information exposed across origins?
Do different origins see different data or the same data?
Does the data change frequently or rarely?
Rarely-changing data exposed to multiple origins
can be used to uniquely identify a user across those origins.
This may be direct
(when the piece of information is unique)
or indirect
(because the data may be combined with other data to form a fingerprint). <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-fingerprinting-guidance">[FINGERPRINTING-GUIDANCE]</a></p>
   <p>When considering whether or not to expose such information,
specs and user agents
should not consider the information in isolation,
but should evaluate the risk of adding it
to the existing fingerprinting surface of the platform.</p>
   <p>Keep in mind that
the fingerprinting risk of a particular piece of information
may vary between platforms.
The fingerprinting risk of some data
on the hardware and software platforms <em>you</em> use
may be different than
the fingerprinting risk on other platforms.</p>
   <p>When you do decide to expose such information,
you should take steps to mitigate the harm of such exposure.</p>
   <p>Sometimes the right answer is to not expose the data in the first place (see <a href="#drop-feature">§ 4.6 Drop the feature</a>).
In other cases,
reducing fingerprintability may be as simple as
ensuring consistency—for instance,
by ordering a list of available resources—but sometimes,
more complex mitigations may be necessary.
See <a href="#mitigations">§ 4 Mitigation Strategies</a> for more.</p>
   <p>If features in your spec expose such data
and does not define adequate mitigations,
you should ensure that such information
is not revealed to origins
without <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#consent">meaningful user consent</a>,
and
you should clearly describe this
in your specification’s Security and Privacy Considerations sections.</p>

   <p>Platforms differ in how they process data passed into them,

   <p>Don’t assume the underlying platform will safely handle the data that is passed.

   <p>Information from sensors may serve as a fingerprinting vector across origins.
Additionally,
sensors may reveal something sensitive about the device or its environment.</p>
   <p>If sensor data is relatively stable

   <p>New mechanisms for executing or loading scripts have a risk of enabling novel attack surfaces.

   <p>If so, what devices do the features in this specification allow an origin to
access?</p>
   <p>Accessing other devices, both via network connections and via
direct connection to the user’s machine (e.g. via Bluetooth,
NFC, or USB), could expose vulnerabilities - some of
these devices were not created with web connectivity in mind and may be inadequately
hardened against malicious input, or with the use on the web.</p>
   <p>Exposing other devices on a user’s local network also has significant privacy
risk:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>If two user agents have the same devices on their local network, an
attacker may infer that the two user agents are running on the same host
or are being used by two separate users who are in the same physical

     <p>Enumerating the devices on a user’s local network provides significant
entropy that an attacker may use to fingerprint the user agent.</p>

    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Direct connections might be also be used to bypass security checks that

   <p>Features that allow for control over a user agent’s UI (e.g. full screen
mode) or changes to the underlying system (e.g. installing an ‘app’ on a
smartphone home screen) may surprise users or obscure security / privacy
controls.  To the extent that your feature does allow for the changing of a

   <p>If a standard exposes a temporary identifier to the web, the identifier
should be short lived and should rotate on some regular duration to mitigate
the risk of this identifier being used to track a user over time.  When a
user clears state in their user agent, these temporary identifiers should be
cleared to prevent re-correlation of state using a temporary identifier.</p>
   <p>If features in this spec create or expose temporary identifiers to the
web, how are they exposed, when, to what entities, and, how frequently are
those temporary identifiers rotated?</p>
   <p>Example temporary identifiers include TLS Channel ID, Session Tickets, and
IPv6 addresses.</p>
   <p id="example-86ed6495"><a href="#example-86ed6495"></a> The index attribute in the Gamepad API <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-gamepad">[GAMEPAD]</a> — an integer that starts
at zero, increments, and is reset — is a good example of a privacy friendly
temporary identifier. </p>
   <h3 data-level="2.13" id="first-third-party"><span>2.13. </span><span> How does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and
  third-party contexts? </span><a href="#first-third-party"></a></h3>
   <p>The behavior of a feature should be considered not just in the context of its
being used by a first party origin that a user is visiting but also the
implications of its being used by an arbitrary third party that the first
party includes. When developing your specification, consider the implications
of its use by third party resources on a page and, consider if support for
use by third party resources should be optional to conform to the
specification.  If supporting use by third party resources is mandatory for
conformance, please explain why and what privacy mitigations are in place.
This is particularly important as user agents may take steps to reduce the
availability or functionality of certain features to third parties if the
third parties are found to be abusing the functionality.</p>
   <h3 data-level="2.14" id="private-browsing"><span>2.14. </span><span> How do the features in this specification work in the context of a browser’s
  Private Browsing or Incognito mode? </span><a href="#private-browsing"></a></h3>
   <p>Most browsers implement a private browsing or incognito mode,
though they vary significantly in what functionality they provide and
how that protection is described to users <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-wu-private-browsing">[WU-PRIVATE-BROWSING]</a>.</p>
   <p>One commonality is that they provide a different set of state
than the browser’s 'normal' state.</p>
   <p>Do features in this spec provide information that would allow for the
correlation of a single user’s activity across normal and private
browsing / incognito modes?  Do features in the spec result in
information being written to a user’s host that would persist
following a private browsing / incognito mode session ending?</p>
   <p>There has been research into both:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Detecting whether a user agent is in private browsing mode <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rivera">[RIVERA]</a> using non-standardized methods such as <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestFileSystem">window.requestFileSystem()</a></code>.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Using features to fingerprint a browser and correlate private and
non-private mode sessions for a given user. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-olejnik-payments">[OLEJNIK-PAYMENTS]</a></p>
   </li></ul>
   <h3 data-level="2.15" id="considerations"><span>2.15. </span><span> Does this specification have both "Security Considerations" and "Privacy
  Considerations" sections? </span><a href="#considerations"></a></h3>
   <p>Specifications should have both "Security Considerations" and "Privacy
Considerations" sections to help implementers and web developers
understand the risks that a feature presents and to ensure that
adequate mitigations are in place.  While your answers to the
questions in this document will inform your writing of those sections,
do not merely copy this questionnaire into those sections.  Instead,
craft language specific to your specification that will be helpful to
implementers and web developers.</p>
   <p><a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc6973">[RFC6973]</a> is an excellent resource to consult when considering
privacy impacts of your specification, particularly Section 7 of
RFC6973. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc3552">[RFC3552]</a> provides general advice as to writing Security
Consideration sections, and Section 5 of RFC3552 has specific requirements.</p>
   <p>Generally, these sections should contain clear descriptions of the
privacy and security risks for the features your spec introduces.  It is also
appropriate to document risks that are mitigated elsewhere in the
specification and to call out details that, if implemented
other-than-according-to-spec, are likely to lead to vulnerabilities.</p>
   <p>If it seems like none of the features in your specification have security or
privacy impacts, say so in-line, e.g.:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>There are no known security impacts of the features in this specification.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Be aware, though, that most specifications include features that have at least some
impact on the fingerprinting surface of the browser.  If you believe
your specification in an outlier, justifying that claim is in
order.</p>
   <h3 data-level="2.16" id="relaxed-sop"><span>2.16. </span><span> Do features in your specification enable origins to downgrade default
  security protections? </span><a href="#relaxed-sop"></a></h3>
   <p>Do features in your spec
enable an origin to opt-out of security settings
in order to accomplish something?
If so,
in what situations do these features allow such downgrading, and why?</p>
   <p>Can this be avoided in the first place?
If not, are mitigations in place
to make sure this downgrading doesn’t dramatically increase risk to users?
For instance, <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-permissions-policy">[PERMISSIONS-POLICY]</a> defines a mechanism
that can be used by sites to prevent untrusted <code><a data-link-type="element" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#the-iframe-element" id="ref-for-the-iframe-element">iframe</a></code>s from using such a feature.</p>
   <p><a href="#example-8a7bc492"></a> The <code><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#dom-document-domain" id="ref-for-dom-document-domain">document.domain</a></code> setter can be used to relax the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#same-origin-policy" id="ref-for-same-origin-policy">same-origin policy</a>.
The most effective mitigation
would be to remove it from the platform (see <a href="#drop-feature">§ 4.6 Drop the feature</a>),
though that <a href="https://github.com/mikewest/deprecating-document-domain/">may be challenging</a> for compatibility reasons. </p>
   <div id="example-3181d7d3">
    <p><a href="#example-3181d7d3"></a> The Fullscreen API enables
a (portion of a) web page
to expand to fill the display. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-fullscreen">[FULLSCREEN]</a> This can hide
several User Agent user interface elements
which help users to understand
what web page they are visiting
and whether or not the User Agent believes they are <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#safe-to-browse">safe</a>. 
    </p><p>Several mitigations are defined in the specification
and are widely deployed in implementations.
For instance, the Fullscreen API is a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions-policy/#policy-controlled-feature" id="ref-for-policy-controlled-feature">policy-controlled feature</a>,
which enables sites to disable the API in <code><a data-link-type="element" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#the-iframe-element" id="ref-for-the-iframe-element①">iframe</a></code>s. <a href="https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#security-and-privacy-considerations"><cite>Fullscreen API</cite> § 7 Security and Privacy Considerations</a> encourages implementations
to display an overlay which informs the user that they have entered fullscreen,
and to advertise a simple mechanism to exit fullscreen (typically the <code>Esc</code> key).</p>

   <h3 data-level="2.17" id="non-fully-active"><span>2.17. </span><span> How does your feature handle non-"fully active" documents? </span><a href="#non-fully-active"></a></h3>
   <p>After a user navigates away from a document,
the document might stay around in a non-"<a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#fully-active" id="ref-for-fully-active">fully active</a>" state,
and might be reused when the user navigates back to the document.
From the user’s perspective,
the non-<a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#fully-active" id="ref-for-fully-active①">fully active</a> document is already discarded
and thus should not get updates/events that happen after they navigated away from it,
especially privacy-sensitive information (e.g. geolocation).
Also, as a document might be reused even after navigation,
be aware that tying something to a document’s lifetime
also means reusing it after navigations.
If this is not desirable,
consider listening to changes to the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#fully-active" id="ref-for-fully-active②">fully active</a> state
and doing cleanup as necessary.</p>
   <p>For more detailed guidance on how to handle non-<a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#fully-active" id="ref-for-fully-active③">fully active</a> documents,

This means after a user triggers activation once on a document,
the document will have sticky activation forever,
even after the user navigated away and back to it again.
Whether this should actually be reset when full activity is lost or not
is still <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6588">under discussion</a>. </p>
   <h3 data-level="2.18" id="missing-questions"><span>2.18. </span><span> What should this questionnaire have asked? </span><a href="#missing-questions"></a></h3>
   <p>This questionnaire is not exhaustive.
After completing a privacy review,
it may be that
there are privacy aspects of your specification
that a strict reading, and response to, this questionnaire,
would not have revealed.
If this is the case,

   <h2 data-level="3" id="threats"><span>3. </span><span>Threat Models</span><a href="#threats"></a></h2>
   <p>To consider security and privacy it is convenient to think in terms of threat
models, a way to illuminate the possible risks.</p>
   <p>There are some concrete privacy concerns that should be considered when
developing a feature for the web platform <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc6973">[RFC6973]</a>:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Surveillance: Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an
individual’s communications or activities.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Stored Data Compromise: End systems that do not take adequate measures to
secure stored data from unauthorized or inappropriate access.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Intrusion: Intrusion consists of invasive acts that disturb or interrupt
one’s life or activities.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Misattribution: Misattribution occurs when data or communications related
to one individual are attributed to another.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Correlation: Correlation is the combination of various pieces of
information related to an individual or that obtain that characteristic
when combined.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Identification: Identification is the linking of information to a
particular individual to infer an individual’s identity or to allow the
inference of an individual’s identity.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Secondary Use: Secondary use is the use of collected information about an
individual without the individual’s consent for a purpose different from
that for which the information was collected.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Disclosure: Disclosure is the revelation of information about an

    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Exclusion: Exclusion is the failure to allow individuals to know about
the data that others have about them and to participate in its handling
and use.</p>
   </li></ul>
   <p>In the mitigations section, this document outlines a number of techniques
that can be applied to mitigate these risks.</p>
   <p>Enumerated below are some broad classes of threats that should be
considered when developing a web feature.</p>
   <h3 data-level="3.1" id="passive-network"><span>3.1. </span><span> Passive Network Attackers </span><a href="#passive-network"></a></h3>
   <p>A <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" data-noexport="" id="passive-network-attacker">passive network attacker</dfn> has read-access to the bits going over
the wire between users and the servers they’re communicating with. She can’t <em>modify</em> the bytes, but she can collect and analyze them.</p>
   <p>Due to the decentralized nature of the internet, and the general level of
interest in user activity, it’s reasonable to assume that practically every
unencrypted bit that’s bouncing around the network of proxies, routers, and
servers you’re using right now is being read by someone. It’s equally likely
that some of these attackers are doing their best to understand the encrypted
bits as well, including storing encrypted communications for later
cryptanalysis (though that requires significantly more effort).</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>The IETF’s "Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack" document <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc7258">[RFC7258]</a> is
useful reading, outlining some of the impacts on privacy that this
assumption entails.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Governments aren’t the only concern; your local coffee shop is likely to
be gathering information on its customers, your ISP at home is likely to
be doing the same.</p>
   </li></ul>
   <h3 data-level="3.2" id="active-network"><span>3.2. </span><span> Active Network Attackers </span><a href="#active-network"></a></h3>
   <p>An <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" data-noexport="" id="active-network-attacker">active network attacker</dfn> has both read- and write-access to the
bits going over the wire between users and the servers they’re communicating
with. She can collect and analyze data, but also modify it in-flight,
injecting and manipulating Javascript, HTML, and other content at will.
This is more common than you might expect, for both benign and malicious
purposes:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>ISPs and caching proxies regularly cache and compress images before
delivering them to users in an effort to reduce data usage. This can be
especially useful for users on low-bandwidth, high-latency devices like
phones.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>ISPs also regularly inject JavaScript <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-comcast">[COMCAST]</a> and other identifiers <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-verizon">[VERIZON]</a> for less benign purposes.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>If your ISP is willing to modify substantial amounts of traffic flowing
through it for profit, it’s difficult to believe that state-level
attackers will remain passive.</p>
   </li></ul>
   <h3 data-level="3.3" id="sop-violations"><span>3.3. </span><span> Same-Origin Policy Violations </span><a href="#sop-violations"></a></h3>
   <p>The <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" data-noexport="" id="same-origin-policy">same-origin policy</dfn> is the cornerstone of security on the web;
one origin should not have direct access to another origin’s data (the policy
is more formally defined in Section 3 of <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc6454">[RFC6454]</a>). A corollary to this
policy is that an origin should not have direct access to data that isn’t
associated with <em>any</em> origin: the contents of a user’s hard drive,
for instance. Various kinds of attacks bypass this protection in one way or
another. For example:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p><dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" data-local-lt="XSS" data-noexport="" id="cross-site-scripting-attacks">Cross-site scripting attacks</dfn> involve an
attacker tricking an origin into executing attacker-controlled code in
the context of a target origin.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" data-local-lt="CSRF" data-noexport="" id="cross-site-request-forgery-attacks">Cross-site request forgery attacks</dfn> trick user
agents into exerting a user’s ambient authority on sites where they’ve
logged in by submitting requests on their behalf.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Data leakage occurs when bits of information are inadvertently made
available cross-origin, either explicitly via CORS headers <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-cors">[CORS]</a>,
or implicitly, via side-channel attacks like <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-timing">[TIMING]</a>.</p>
   </li></ul>
   <h3 data-level="3.4" id="third-party-tracking"><span>3.4. </span><span> Third-Party Tracking </span><a href="#third-party-tracking"></a></h3>
   <p>Part of the power of the web is its ability for a page to pull in content
from other third parties — from images to javascript — to enhance the content
and/or a user’s experience of the site.  However, when a page pulls in
content from third parities, it inherently leaks some information to third
parties — referer information and other information that may be used to track
and profile a user.  This includes the fact that cookies go back to the
domain that initially stored them allowing for cross origin tracking.
Moreover, third parties can gain execution power through third party
Javascript being included by a webpage.  While pages can take steps to
mitigate the risks of third party content and browsers may differentiate
how they treat first and third party content from a given page, the risk of
new functionality being executed by third parties rather than the first party
site should be considered in the feature development process.</p>
   <p>The simplest example is injecting a link to a site that behaves differently
under specific condition, for example based on the fact that user is or is not
logged to the site. This may reveal that the user has an account on a site.</p>
   <h3 data-level="3.5" id="legitimate-misuse"><span>3.5. </span><span> Legitimate Misuse </span><a href="#legitimate-misuse"></a></h3>
   <p>Even when powerful features are made available to developers, it does not
mean that all the uses should always be a good idea, or justified; in fact,
data privacy regulations around the world may even put limits on certain uses
of data. In the context of first party, a legitimate website is potentially
able to interact with powerful features to learn about user behavior or
habits. For example:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>Tracking the user while browsing the website via mechanisms such as mouse
move tracking</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Behavioral profiling of the user based on the usage patterns</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Accessing powerful features that enable the first-party to learn about
the user’s system, the user themselves, or the user’s susurroundings, such
as could be done through a webcam or sensors</p>
   </li></ul>
   <p>This point is admittedly different from others - and underlines that even if
something may be possible, it does not mean it should always be done,
including the need for considering a privacy impact assessment or even an
ethical assessment. When designing features with security and privacy
in mind, all both use and misuse cases should be in scope.</p>
   <h2 data-level="4" id="mitigations"><span>4. </span><span> Mitigation Strategies </span><a href="#mitigations"></a></h2>
   <p>To mitigate the security and privacy risks you’ve identified in your
specification,
you may want to apply one or more of the mitigations described below.</p>
   <h3 data-level="4.1" id="data-minimization"><span>4.1. </span><span> Data Minimization </span><a href="#data-minimization"></a></h3>
   <p>Minimization is a strategy that involves exposing as little information to
other communication partners as is required for a given operation to
complete. More specifically, it requires not providing access to more
information than was apparent in the user-mediated access or allowing the
user some control over which information exactly is provided.</p>
   <p>For example, if the user has provided access to a given file, the object
representing that should not make it possible to obtain information about
that file’s parent directory and its contents as that is clearly not what is
expected.</p>
   <p>In context of data minimization it is natural to ask what data is passed
around between the different parties, how persistent the data items and
identifiers are, and whether there are correlation possibilities between
different protocol runs.</p>
   <p>For example, the W3C Device APIs Working Group has defined a number of
requirements in their Privacy Requirements document. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-dap-privacy-reqs">[DAP-PRIVACY-REQS]</a></p>
   <p>Data minimization is applicable to specification authors and implementers, as
well as to those deploying the final service.</p>
   <p>As an example, consider mouse events. When a page is loaded, the application
has no way of knowing whether a mouse is attached, what type of mouse it is
(e.g., make and model), what kind of capabilities it exposes, how many are
attached, and so on. Only when the user decides to use the mouse — presumably
because it is required for interaction — does some of this information become
available. And even then, only a minimum of information is exposed: you could
not know whether it is a trackpad for instance, and the fact that it may have
a right button is only exposed if it is used. For instance, the Gamepad API
makes use of this data minimization capability. It is impossible for a Web game
to know if the user agent has access to gamepads, how many there are, what
their capabilities are, etc. It is simply assumed that if the user wishes to
interact with the game through the gamepad then she will know when to action
it — and actioning it will provide the application with all the information
that it needs to operate (but no more than that).</p>
   <p>The way in which the functionality is supported for the mouse is simply by
only providing information on the mouse’s behaviour when certain events take
place. The approach is therefore to expose event handling (e.g., triggering
on click, move, button press) as the sole interface to the device.</p>
   <p>Two specifications that have minimized the data their features expose
are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p><a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-battery-status">[BATTERY-STATUS]</a> <q>The user agent should not expose high precision readouts</q></p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-generic-sensor">[GENERIC-SENSOR]</a> <q>Limit maximum sampling frequency</q>, <q>Reduce accuracy</q></p>
   </li></ul>
   <h3 data-level="4.2" id="privacy-friendly-defaults"><span>4.2. </span><span> Default Privacy Settings </span><a href="#privacy-friendly-defaults"></a></h3>
   <p>Users often do not change defaults, as a result, it is important that the
default mode of a specification minimizes the amount, identifiability, and
persistence of the data and identifiers exposed.  This is particularly true
if a protocol comes with flexible options so that it can be tailored to
specific environments.</p>
   <h3 data-level="4.3" id="user-mediation"><span>4.3. </span><span> Explicit user mediation </span><a href="#user-mediation"></a></h3>
   <p>If the security or privacy risk of a feature cannot otherwise be mitigated in
a specification, optionally allowing an implementer to prompt a user may
be the best mitigation possible, understanding it does not entirely remove
the privacy risk.  If the specification does not allow for the implementer to
prompt, it may result in divergence implementations by different user agents
as some user agents choose to implement more privacy-friendly version.</p>
   <p>It is possible that the risk of a feature cannot be mitigated because the
risk is endemic to the feature itself.  For instance, <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-geolocation-api">[GEOLOCATION-API]</a> reveals a user’s location intentionally; user agents generally gate access to
the feature on a permission prompt which the user may choose to accept.  This
risk is also present and should be accounted for in features that expose
personal data or identifiers.</p>
   <p>Designing such prompts is difficult as is determining the duration that the
permission should provide.</p>
   <p>Often, the best prompt is one that is clearly tied to a user action, like the
file picker, where in response to a user action, the file picker is brought
up and a user gives access to a specific file to an individual site.</p>
   <p>Generally speaking, the duration and timing of the prompt should be inversely
proportional to the risk posed by the data exposed.  In addition, the prompt
should consider issues such as:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>How should permission requests be scoped? Especially when requested by an
embedded third party iframe?</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Should persistence be based on the pair of top-level/embedded origins or a
different scope?</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>How is it certain that the prompt is occurring in context of requiring the
data and at a time that it is clear to the user why the prompt is occurring.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Explaining the implications of permission before prompting the user, in a
way that is accessible and localized -- _who_ is asking, _what_ are they
asking for, _why_ do they need it?</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>What happens if the user rejects the request at the time of the prompt or
if the user later changes their mind and revokes access.</p>
   </li></ul>
   <p>These prompts should also include considerations for what, if any, control a
user has over their data after it has been shared with other parties.  For
example, are users able to determine what information was shared with other
parties?</p>
   <h3 data-level="4.4" id="restrict-to-first-party"><span>4.4. </span><span> Explicitly restrict the feature to first party origins </span><a href="#restrict-to-first-party"></a></h3>
   <p>As described in the "Third-Party Tracking" section, web pages mix
first and third party content into a single application, which
introduces the risk that third party content can misuse the same set of web
features as first party content.</p>
   <p>Authors should explicitly specify a feature’s scope of availability:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p>When a feature should be made available to embedded third parties -- and
often first parties should be able to explicitly control that (using
iframe attributes or feature policy)</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Whether a feature should be available in the background or only in the
top-most, visible tab.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Whether a feature should be available to offline service workers.</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p>Whether events will be fired simultaneously</p>
   </li></ul>
   <p>Third party access to a feature should be an optional implementation for

   <h3 data-level="4.5" id="secure-contexts"><span>4.5. </span><span> Secure Contexts </span><a href="#secure-contexts"></a></h3>
   <p>If the primary risk that you’ve identified in your specification is the
threat posed by <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#active-network-attacker" id="ref-for-active-network-attacker②">active network attacker</a>, offering a feature to an
insecure origin is the same as offering that feature to every origin because
the attacker can inject frames and code at will. Requiring an encrypted and
authenticated connection in order to use a feature can mitigate this kind of
risk.</p>
   <p>Secure contexts also protect against <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#passive-network-attacker" id="ref-for-passive-network-attacker">passive network attackers</a>.  For
example, if a page uses the Geolocation API and sends the sensor-provided
latitude and longitude back to the server over an insecure connection, then
any passive network attacker can learn the user’s location, without any
feasible path to detection by the user or others.</p>
   <p>However, requiring a secure context is not sufficient to mitigate many
privacy risks or even security risks from other threat actors than active
network attackers.</p>
   <h3 data-level="4.6" id="drop-feature"><span>4.6. </span><span> Drop the feature </span><a href="#drop-feature"></a></h3>
   <p>Possibly the simplest way
to mitigate potential negative security or privacy impacts of a feature
is to drop the feature,
though you should keep in mind that some security or privacy risks
may be removed or mitigated
by adding features to the platform.
Every feature in a specification
should be seen as
potentially adding security and/or privacy risk
until proven otherwise.
Discussing dropping the feature
as a mitigation for security or privacy impacts
is a helpful exercise
as it helps illuminate the tradeoffs
between the feature,
whether it is exposing the minimum amount of data necessary,
and other possible mitigations.</p>
   <p>Consider also the cumulative effect
of feature addition
to the overall impression that users have
that <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#safe-to-browse">it is safe to visit a web page</a>.
Doing things that complicate users' understanding
that it is safe to visit websites,
or that complicate what users need to understand
about the safety of the web
(e.g., adding features that are less safe)
reduces the ability of users
to act based on that understanding of safety,
or to act in ways that correctly reflect the safety that exists.</p>
   <p>Every specification should seek to be as small as possible, even if only
for the reasons of reducing and minimizing security/privacy attack surface(s).
By doing so we can reduce the overall security and privacy attack surface
of not only a particular feature, but of a module (related set of
features), a specification, and the overall web platform.</p>
   <p>Examples</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1313580">Mozilla</a> and <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164213">WebKit</a> dropped the Battery Status API</p>
    </li><li data-md="">
     <p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1359076">Mozilla dropped</a> devicelight, deviceproximity and userproximity events</p>
   </li></ul>
   <h3 data-level="4.7" id="privacy-impact-assessment"><span>4.7. </span><span> Making a privacy impact assessment </span><a href="#privacy-impact-assessment"></a></h3>
   <p>Some features potentially supply sensitive data, and it is
the responsibility of the end-developer, system owner, or manager to realize
this and act accordingly in the design of their system. Some use may
warrant conducting a privacy impact assessment, especially when data
relating to individuals may be processed.</p>
   <p>Specifications that include features that expose sensitive data should include
recommendations that websites and applications adopting the API conduct a
privacy impact assessment of the data that they collect.</p>
   <p>A feature that does this is:</p>
   <ul>
    <li data-md="">
     <p><a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-generic-sensor">[GENERIC-SENSOR]</a> advises to consider performing of a privacy impact
assessment</p>
   </li></ul>
   <p>Documenting these impacts is important for organizations although it should
be noted that there are limitations to putting this onus on organizations.
Research has shown that sites often do not comply with security/privacy
requirements in specifications.  For example, in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-doty-geolocation">[DOTY-GEOLOCATION]</a>, it was
found that none of the studied websites informed users of their privacy
practices before the site prompted for location.</p>
