      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Until fairly recently, if you lived anywhere other than San Francisco, it was possible to go days or even weeks without hearing about cryptocurrency.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Now, suddenly, it’s inescapable. Look one way, and there are Matt Damon and Larry David doing ads for crypto start-ups. Swivel your head — oh, hey, it’s the mayors of Miami and New York City, arguing over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/business/crypto-mayors.html">who loves Bitcoin more</a>. Two N.B.A. arenas are now named after crypto companies, and it seems as if every corporate marketing team in America has jumped on the NFT — or nonfungible token — bandwagon. (Can I interest you in one of Pepsi’s new “Mic Drop” genesis NFTs? Or maybe something from Applebee’s “Metaverse Meals” NFT collection, inspired by the restaurant chain’s “iconic” menu items?)<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Crypto! For years, it seemed like the kind of fleeting tech trend most people could safely ignore, like hoverboards or Google Glass. But its power, both economic and cultural, has become too big to overlook. Twenty percent of American adults, and 36 percent of millennials, own cryptocurrency, according to a recent <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/05/2022-consumer-electronics-show/">Morning Consult survey</a>. Coinbase, the crypto trading app, has landed on top of the App Store’s top charts <a href="https://decrypt.co/84653/coinbase-returns-to-no-1-in-apple-us-app-store">at least twice</a> in the past year. Today, the crypto market is valued at around $1.75 trillion — roughly the size of Google. And in Silicon Valley, engineers and executives are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/20/technology/silicon-valley-cryptocurrency-start-ups.html">bolting from cushy jobs</a> in droves to join the crypto gold rush.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As it’s gone mainstream, crypto has inspired an unusually polarized discourse. Its biggest fans think it’s saving the world, while its biggest skeptics are convinced it’s all a scam — an environment-killing speculative bubble orchestrated by grifters and sold to greedy dupes, which will probably crash the economy when it bursts.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I’ve been writing about crypto for nearly a decade, a period in which my own views have whipsawed between extreme skepticism and cautious optimism. These days, I usually describe myself as a crypto moderate, although I admit that may be a cop-out.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->I agree with the skeptics that much of the crypto market consists of overvalued, overhyped and possibly fraudulent assets, and I am unmoved by the most utopian sentiments shared by pro-crypto zealots (such as the claim by Jack Dorsey, the former Twitter chief, that Bitcoin will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/jack-dorsey-hopes-bitcoin-will-help-bring-about-world-peace.html">usher in world peace</a>).<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But as I’ve experimented more with crypto — including accidentally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/technology/nft-sale.html">selling an NFT for more than $500,000</a> in a charity auction last year — I’ve come to accept that it isn’t all a cynical money-grab, and that there are things of actual substance being built. I’ve also learned, in my career as a tech journalist, that when so much money, energy and talent flows toward a new thing, it’s generally a good idea to pay attention, regardless of your views on the thing itself.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->My strongest-held belief about crypto, though, is that it is terribly explained.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Recently, I spent several months reading everything I could about crypto. But I found that most beginner’s guides took the form of boring podcasts, thinly researched YouTube videos and blog posts written by hopelessly biased investors. Many anti-crypto takes, on the other hand, were undercut by inaccuracies and outdated arguments, such as the assertion that crypto is good for criminals, notwithstanding the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/technology/bitcoin-untraceable-pipeline-ransomware.html">growing </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/13/nyregion/bitcoin-bitfinex-hack-heather-morgan-ilya-lichtenstein.html">evidence </a>that crypto’s traceable ledgers make it a poor fit for illicit activity.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What I couldn’t find was a sober, dispassionate explanation of what crypto actually <span>is</span> — how it works, who it’s for, what’s at stake, where the battle lines are drawn — along with answers to some of the most common questions it raises.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This guide — a mega-F.A.Q., really — is an attempt to fix that. In it, I’ll explain the basic concepts as clearly as I can, doing my best to answer the questions a curious but open-minded skeptic might pose.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Crypto boosters will likely quibble with my explanations, while dug-in opponents may find them too generous. That’s OK. My goal is not to convince you that crypto is good or bad, that it should be outlawed or celebrated, or that investing in it will make you rich or bankrupt you. It is simply to demystify things a bit. And if you want to go deeper, each section has a list of reading suggestions at the end.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Understanding crypto now — especially if you’re naturally skeptical — is important for a few reasons.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The first is that crypto wealth and ideology is going to be a transformative force in our society in the coming years.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->You’ve heard about the overnight <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/technology/hes-a-dogecoin-millionaire-and-hes-not-selling.html">Dogecoin millionaires</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html">Lamborghini-driving Bitcoin bros</a>. But that’s not the half of it. The crypto boom has generated vast new fortunes at a clip we’ve never seen before — the closest comparison is probably the discovery of oil in the Middle East — and has turned its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-01-09/binance-ceo-cz-s-net-worth-billionaire-holds-world-s-biggest-crypto-fortune">biggest winners</a> into some of the richest people in the world, essentially overnight. Some riches could vanish if the market crashes, but enough has already been cashed out to ensure that crypto’s influence will linger for decades.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Crypto’s madcap, meme-crazed online culture can make it seem frivolous and shallow. It’s not. Cryptocurrencies, even the jokey ones, are part of a robust, well-funded ideological movement that has serious implications for our political and economic future. Bitcoin, which emerged out of the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis, first caught on among libertarians and anti-establishment activists who saw it as the cornerstone of a new, incorruptible monetary system. Since then, other crypto realms have fashioned similarly lofty goals, like building a decentralized, largely unregulated version of Wall Street on the blockchain.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->We are already starting to see a swell of crypto money headed toward the U.S. political system. Crypto entrepreneurs are <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/sam-bankman-fried-biden-donor.html">donating millions of dollars to candidates</a> and causes, and lobbying firms have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/business/dealbook/crypto-lobbyists.html">fanned out</a> across the country to win support for pro-crypto legislation. In the coming years, crypto moguls will bankroll the campaigns of crypto-friendly candidates, or run for office themselves. Some will peddle influence in the familiar ways — forming super PACs, funding think tanks, etc. — while others will try to escape partisan gridlock altogether. (Crypto millionaires are already <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3n38x/cryptocurrency-investors-try-to-turn-private-islands-into-blockchain-utopias">buying up land in the South Pacific</a> to build their own blockchain utopias.)<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Crypto is poised to soon become one of a handful of true wedge issues, with politicians all over the world forced to pick a side. Some countries, like El Salvador — whose crypto-loving president, Nayib Bukele, recently <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/bitcoin-city-el-salvador-inspired-ancient-greeks-s-reality-check-rcna6944">announced </a>the development of a “Bitcoin City” at the base of a volcano — will go full crypto. Other governments may decide that crypto is a threat to their sovereignty and crack down, as China did when it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/business/china-cryptocurrency-bitcoin.html">outlawed cryptocurrency trading</a> last year. The divide between the world’s pro-crypto and no-crypto zones could end up being at least as big as the divide between the Chinese internet and the American one, and maybe even more consequential.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In America, we have already seen how crypto can scramble the usual partisan allegiances. Former President Donald J. Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, are united in crypto skepticism, for example, while Senator Ted Cruz, Republican from Texas, is in the same bullish camp as Senator Ron Wyden, the Democrat from Oregon. We have also seen what can happen when the crypto community feels politically threatened, as happened last summer, when crypto groups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/politics/infrastructure-cryptocurrency.html">rallied to oppose a crypto-related provision</a> in President Biden’s infrastructure bill.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What I’m saying, I guess, is that despite the goofy veneer, crypto is not just another weird internet phenomenon. It’s an organized technological movement, armed with powerful tools and hordes of wealthy true believers, whose goal is nothing less than a total economic and political revolution.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In the early 2010s, the most common knock on social media apps like Facebook and Twitter was that they just wouldn’t work as businesses. Pundits predicted that users would eventually tire of their friends’ vacation photos, that advertisers would flee and that the whole social media industry would collapse.

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What nobody was asking back then — at least not loudly — were questions like: What if social media is actually <span>insanely successful</span>? What kind of regulations would need to exist in a world where Facebook and Twitter were the dominant communication platforms?

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Are we making the same mistake with crypto today? It’s possible. No one knows yet whether crypto will or won’t “work,” in the grandest sense. (Anyone who claims they do is selling something.) But there is real money and energy in it, and many tech veterans I’ve spoken to tell me that today’s crypto scene feels, to them, like 2010 all over again — with tech disrupting money this time, instead of media.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

Surveys have suggested that <a href="https://cheddar.com/media/crypto-investor-white-male-survey-demographic-change">high-earning white men</a> make up a large share of crypto owners, and libertarians with dog-eared copies of “Atlas Shrugged” are likely overrepresented among crypto millionaires. But it’s not an intellectual monolith. There are right-wing Bitcoin maximalists who believe that crypto will liberate them from government tyranny; left-wing Ethereum fans who want to overthrow the big banks; and speculators with no ideological attachments who just want to turn a profit and get out. These communities fight with one another constantly, and many have wildly different ideas about what crypto should be.

        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A decade or two ago, the word was generally used as shorthand for cryptography. But in recent years, it’s been more closely associated with cryptocurrencies. These days, “crypto” usually refers to the entire universe of technologies that involve blockchains — the distributed ledger systems that power digital currencies like Bitcoin, but also serve as the base layer of technology for things like NFTs, web3 applications and DeFi trading protocols.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Ah yes, blockchains. Can you remind me, without going into too much technical detail, what they are?</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->At a very basic level, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/business/dealbook/blockchains-guide-information.html">blockchains</a> are shared databases that store and verify information in a cryptographically secure way.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->You can think of a blockchain like a Google spreadsheet, except that instead of being hosted on Google’s servers, blockchains are maintained by a network of computers all over the world. These computers (sometimes called miners or validators) are responsible for storing their own copies of the database, adding and verifying new entries, and securing the database against hackers.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>So blockchains are … fancy Google spreadsheets?</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sort of! But there are at least three important conceptual differences.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->First, a blockchain is decentralized. It doesn’t need a company like Google overseeing it. All of that work is done by the computers on the network, using what’s called a consensus mechanism — basically, a complicated algorithm that allows them to agree on what’s in a database without the need for a neutral referee. This makes blockchains more secure than traditional record-keeping systems, proponents believe, since no single person or company can take down the blockchain or alter its contents, and anyone trying to hack or change the records in the ledger would need to break into many computers simultaneously.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The second major feature of blockchains is that they’re typically public and open source, meaning that unlike a Google spreadsheet, anyone can inspect a public blockchain’s code or see a record of any transaction. (There are private blockchains, but they’re less important than the public ones.)<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Third, blockchains are typically append-only and permanent, meaning that unlike with a Google spreadsheet, data that’s added to a blockchain typically can’t be deleted or changed after the fact.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>Got it. So blockchains are public, permanent databases that nobody owns?</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Blockchains didn’t really exist until 2009, when a pseudonymous programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto released the technical documentation for Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Bitcoin used a blockchain to keep track of transactions. That was notable because, for the first time, it allowed people to send and receive money over the internet without needing to involve a central authority, such as a bank or an app like PayPal or Venmo.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Many blockchains still perform cryptocurrency transactions, and there are now roughly 10,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, according to CoinMarketCap. But many blockchains can be used to store other kinds of information, too — including NFTs, bits of self-executing code known as smart contracts and full-fledged apps — without the need for a central authority.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><strong>OK, but can we back up a second? Weren’t tech people telling us, years ago, that crypto was a new and exciting form of money? And yet, nobody I know pays their rent or buys groceries in Bitcoin. So were those people just … wrong?</strong><!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Good question. It’s true that today, hardly anyone pays for things in cryptocurrency. In part, that’s because most merchants still don’t accept crypto payments, and hefty transaction fees can make it impractical to spend small amounts of cryptocurrency on daily living expenses. It’s also because the value of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether has historically gone up, making it somewhat risky to use them for offline purchases. (The counterexamples are usually cited with pity, like the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-pizza-day-laszlo-hanyecz-spent-3-8-billion-on-pizzas-in-the-summer-of-2010-using-the-novel-crypto-11621714395">guy </a>who, in 2010, bought two Papa John’s pizzas using Bitcoin that was worth about $40 at the time, but would be worth roughly $400 million today.)<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->It’s also true that the value of cryptocurrencies has grown enormously since the early Bitcoin days, despite them <span>not</span> being most people’s daily spending money.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Part of that growth is speculation — people buying crypto assets in hopes of selling them for more later on. Part of it is because the blockchains that have emerged since Bitcoin, like Ethereum and Solana, have expanded what can be done with this technology.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Right now, many of the successful applications for crypto technology are in finance or finance-adjacent fields.  For example, people are using crypto to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/new-study-crypto-emerging-as-favored-form-for-cross-border-remittances/">send cross-border remittances</a> to family members abroad and  Wall Street banks <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/wells-fargo-hsbc-settle-forex-104550015.html">using blockchains</a> to settle foreign transactions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
        </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The crypto boom has also led to an explosion of experiments outside of financial services. There are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html">crypto social clubs</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-25/axie-infinity-how-game-is-turning-pandemic-jobless-into-crypto-nft-traders">crypto video games</a>, <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2022/1/13/22880787/worlds-first-nft-restaurant-flyfish-club-opening-nyc">crypto restaurants </a>and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html">crypto-powered wireless networks</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->These non-financial uses are still fairly limited. But crypto fans often make the case that the technology is still young, and that it took the internet decades to mature into what it is today. Investors are pouring billions of dollars into crypto start-ups because they think that someday, blockchains will be used for all kinds of things: storing medical records, tracking streaming music rights, even hosting new social media platforms. And the crypto ecosystem is <a href="https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d">attracting tons of developers</a> — an auspicious sign for any new technology.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Unlike buying stock in, say, Apple, a purchase that (theoretically, at least) reflects a belief that Apple’s underlying business is healthy, buying a cryptocurrency is more like betting on the success of an idea, they say.

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Only slightly. In the United States, certain centralized crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, are required to register as money transmitters and follow laws like the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires them to collect certain information about their customers. Some countries have passed more stringent regulations, and others, like China, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/business/china-cryptocurrency-bitcoin.html">banned</a> cryptocurrency trading entirely.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But compared with the traditional financial system, crypto is very lightly regulated. There are few rules governing crypto assets like “stablecoins” — coins whose value is pegged to government-backed currencies — or even clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service about how certain crypto investments should be taxed. And certain areas of crypto, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/what-is-defi-cryptocurrency.html">DeFi</a> (decentralized finance), are almost completely unregulated.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sorry, Cardi. The dollar is the world’s reserve currency, and dislodging it would be a huge, costly project that isn’t likely to happen any time soon.

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->There are also technical hurdles crypto needs to overcome if it’s ever going to displace government-issued currency. Today, the most popular blockchains — Bitcoin and Ethereum — are slow and inefficient compared with traditional payment networks.

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some are. Because you can buy and sell cryptocurrency without using your name or having a bank account, crypto in its early days was a natural fit for people who had reasons to avoid the traditional financial system. They included criminals, tax evaders and people buying and selling illicit goods. They also included political dissidents and extremists, some of whom had been kicked off more mainstream payment services like PayPal and Patreon.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As a result of their well-timed entry into the crypto market, some extremists have gotten rich. A recent <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2021/12/09/how-cryptocurrency-revolutionized-white-supremacist-movement">investigation </a>by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that several prominent white supremacists have made hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars by investing in crypto.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Of course, there are millions of crypto owners, the vast majority of whom are not white supremacists. And the same properties of anonymity and censorship-resistance that make crypto useful to white supremacists might also make it attractive to, say, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/01/19/crypto-afghanistan-sanctions-taliban/">Afghan citizens fleeing the Taliban</a>. So labeling the entire crypto movement an extremist group would be overkill.

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Let’s start with what we know for sure. It’s true that most crypto activity today takes place on blockchains that require large amounts of energy to store and verify transactions. These networks use a “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism — a process that has been compared to a global guessing game, played by computers all competing to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to add new information to the database and earn a reward in return. Solving these puzzles requires powerful computers, which in turn use lots of energy.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The Bitcoin blockchain, for example, uses an estimated 200 terawatt-hours of energy per year, according to Digiconomist, a website that <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">tracks crypto energy usage</a>. That’s comparable to the annual energy consumption of Thailand. And Bitcoin’s associated carbon emissions have been estimated at roughly 100 megatons per year, which is comparable to the carbon footprint of the Czech Republic.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->• Our existing financial system also uses a lot of energy, between powering millions of bank branches, A.T.M.s that sit idle for most of the day, gold mines and other energy-intensive infrastructure.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->• Most newer blockchains are built using consensus mechanisms that require much less energy than proof-of-work. (Ethereum, for example, is scheduled to switch to a new type of consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake sometime in 2022, which could reduce its energy usage by as much as 99.5 percent.)<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Partly. It’s true that most newer blockchains are designed in a way that requires considerably less energy than Bitcoin, and that Ethereum’s switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism will greatly shrink its environmental footprint, if and when it happens.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But it’s also a bit convenient to steer attention away from Bitcoin, which is still the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Bitcoin’s energy needs aren’t expected to fall significantly anytime soon. And even if every Bitcoin miner ran entirely on renewable energy — which, to be clear, isn’t the case — there would still be an environmental cost associated with maintaining the blockchain.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

      <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->All told, it’s clear that crypto as we know it today has a significant environmental impact, but it’s hard to measure exactly how significant. Many frequently cited statistics come from industry groups, and it’s hard to find trustworthy, independent data and analysis.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

As people like the Bloomberg journalist <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/bitcoin-is-a-faith-based-asset-joe-weisenthal">Joe Weisenthal have pointed out,</a> crypto has similar elements to an emerging religion: an enigmatic founder (the still-anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto), sacred texts (the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a>) and rituals and rites to mark yourself as a believer, such as tweeting “gm” (crypto speak for “good morning”) to your fellow believers, or photoshopping <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-look-at-the-origins-of-bitcoin-laser-eyes-as-el-salvadors-president-dons-them-2021-06-07">laser eyes</a> onto your profile picture.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
