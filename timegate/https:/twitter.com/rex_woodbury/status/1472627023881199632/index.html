                        Tokens translate social capital into economic capital. This financialization of everything has its downsides (there should be protections when investing in a person's token) but tokens can also bootstrap liquidity for a creator &amp; deliver that creator's community economic upside.</p>

                        In the future, weâ€™ll buy, sell, and compare creator tokens as easily as we buy, sell, and compare stocks today. The experience will live in a Coinbase-like interface for trading social tokens.

Creators can earn a share of secondary transactions, unlocking a new revenue stream.</p>
