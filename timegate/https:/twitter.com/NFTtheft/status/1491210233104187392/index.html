                        Fortunately, the scammers shut down the project before they could take any money from victims, but this was clearly a larger and more well-run project than most we've dealt with in the past. This public post helped shut them down. https://t.co/swBRXWIqVy</p>

                        There are many similar NFT projects popping up every week. They are well-organized and often built with stolen art. Like @KarutiNFT, who didn't even remove the original artist's watermark! https://t.co/P2jDtktyZC</p>

                        This is problematic for artists though. If scammers are this invested &amp; organized, they are more likely to try to lash out at artists who accuse them of art theft. When @ranchydoodle called out a project for stealing his art, that project shared this public message on Instagram. https://t.co/HXYXv7ILX9</p>

                        So what do we do now? Good question. We hope all our artist friends keep making and sharing their work. We'll do our best to keep calling out the thieves. Things are already bad enough with the big NFT marketplaces, hopefully this influx of organized criminals will go away soon.</p>
